## 0.7.32

### Patch Changes

- f4f954b: Dogfood the extensible-gates seam: the built-in polling-gate suite (`ci`, `conflicts`,
  `post-release-health` + the `on-call` escalation) is no longer hard-coded in the engine —
  it ships as a new **`@cat-factory/gates`** package authored ENTIRELY through the public
  `registerGate` seam, depending only on kernel + contracts. If the platform's own gates can
  be expressed as an external package, so can any deployment's.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, no migration):** the `ci` / `conflicts` / `post-release-health`
  providers leave the engine. `ciStatusProvider`, `mergeabilityProvider`,
  `releaseHealthProvider` and `incidentEnrichment` are removed from
  `ExecutionServiceDependencies` / `CoreDependencies`; a deployment now wires them into the
  gate suite via the exported `wireCiStatusProvider` / `wireMergeabilityProvider` /
  `wireReleaseHealthProvider` / `wireIncidentEnrichment` handles after
  `import '@cat-factory/gates'`. The merge collaborators (`pullRequestMerger`,
  `branchUpdater`) stay on the engine.

  - **gates (new)**: the three gate factories + the four provider wire-handles +
    `registerBuiltinGates()`, registered as an import side effect. Each gate is a
    pass-through until its provider is wired, so a bare import is always safe. Also exports
    `applyGateProviders(overrides)` + the `GateProviderOverrides` bag: a facade build resets
    the deployment-global providers up-front then re-wires from config, and this is the seam
    that re-applies explicit/faked providers AFTER that wiring (so they survive the Worker's
    per-request rebuild and override a config-wired provider) — used by the cross-runtime
    conformance suite to drive the externalized `ci` gate over a controlled verdict.
  - **kernel**: the pure gate logic (`aggregateCi`/`classifyReleaseHealth`/… +
    `renderReleaseEvidence`) and the gate/helper agent-kind constants move into
    `domain/gate-logic.ts` so a gate package can author a gate without depending on the
    engine. New `GateDefinition.resolveHelperCompletion` hook (+ `GateHelperJobResult` /
    `GateHelperCompletionArgs`): the seam an INVESTIGATE-don't-fix helper (`on-call`) needs
    to settle a gate without re-probing — the real gap the dogfood surfaced.
  - **orchestration**: the three inline gates + the bespoke `resolveOnCallStep` /
    `raiseReleaseRegression` / `enrichIncident` / `raiseCiFailed` branches are deleted; the
    engine builds its gate registry purely from what's registered, and drives an on-call-style
    helper completion through the generic `resolveHelperCompletion` hook. The **`merger`**
    step resolver stays a privileged built-in (reclassified): it owns terminal block status
    and executes a policy-gated real merge — a different archetype from the light, externally
    authorable resolvers, so it keeps its engine-internal access rather than the public seam.
  - **worker / node-server**: each facade `import`s `@cat-factory/gates` and wires its
    existing provider impls (`GitHubCiStatusProvider`, `RegistryReleaseHealthProvider`, …)
    via the `wireX` handles instead of threading them through the engine. `local-server`
    inherits this through `buildNodeContainer`.
  - **conformance**: a new cross-runtime assertion drives the externalized built-in `ci`
    gate (green pass-through, red → ci-fixer → re-probe) over a faked provider on both
    runtimes; the registered-gate test now restores the built-ins after clearing the shared
    registry.

## 0.7.30

### Patch Changes

- 7346a4f: Make the polling **Gate** and **StepCompletionResolver** mechanisms externally
  extensible, so a company-authored deployment package can register its OWN full-blown gate
  (deterministic probe + helper/companion agent + exhaustion handling) or step resolver
  purely via an import side effect — exactly the way it already registers a custom agent
  kind. No fork, no engine patch, and no executor-harness image change (pure backend TS).

  - **kernel**: new `domain/gate-registry.ts` (`registerGate(kind, factory)` +
    `GateDefinition`/`GateContext`/`GateProbe`/`recordGateAttempt`/…) and
    `domain/step-resolver-registry.ts` (`registerStepResolver(kind, factory)` +
    `StepCompletionResolver`/`ResolverContext`/…), moved out of orchestration so an
    extension package depends only on kernel + agents. `RaiseNotificationInput` moved to
    `ports/notification-channel.ts` so the runtime-neutral `GateContext` can build one. A
    registered gate/resolver is a `(ctx) => Definition` factory the engine invokes once at
    registry-build time — solving the `this`-capture the built-in gates rely on while
    keeping them inline and unchanged.
  - **orchestration**: `ExecutionService.buildGateRegistry()` /
    `buildStepResolverRegistry()` now merge the deployment-registered factories with the
    built-ins (registered replaces built-in of the same kind, last-wins) via new
    `makeGateContext()`/`makeResolverContext()` seams; the gate/resolver types are
    re-exported from the package index for discovery.
  - **example-custom-agent**: registers a `license-check` gate (escalating to a new
    `license-fixer` agent kind) + an auditor step resolver + a `wireLicenseProvider` seam,
    proving a custom gate ships with zero engine changes.
  - **conformance**: a new cross-runtime assertion drives a registered custom gate
    (pass-through, escalate-then-pass) and a registered step resolver on both runtimes.

### Minor Changes

- 7cf2a2d: Improve the pipeline builder experience:

  - **Grouped, collapsible agent palette** — archetypes are now organized into
    meaningful categories (Review & triage, Design & research, Implementation,
    Testing, Documentation, Gates & observability) that collapse/expand, with the
    collapsed state remembered across builder opens.
  - **Pipeline labels + archive/unarchive** — pipelines (built-in and custom) carry
    free-form labels and an archived flag for organizing the library: filter by
    label, hide archived behind a toggle, and archive without deleting. Exposed via
    a new `PATCH /workspaces/:ws/pipelines/:id/organize` endpoint (the only mutation
    a read-only built-in accepts). New `pipelines.labels` / `pipelines.archived`
    columns mirror across D1 and Drizzle/Postgres.
  - **Dependent companions are now gated toggles on their producer** — the three
    companions (reviewer→coder, architect-companion→architect, spec-companion→
    spec-writer) leave the free palette and are attached to their producer step in
    the builder. Each can be optionally **gated on the task estimate** (run only when
    complexity/risk/impact ≥ a threshold, OR across axes) via a new per-step
    `gating` array; a gated step is transparently skipped at runtime when the
    estimate falls below the bar. A pipeline with any enabled gating **requires a
    `task-estimator` earlier in the chain** or it refuses to save/start. Gating is
    additionally restricted to **companion steps** (skipping a producer would starve
    its downstream steps) and **requires at least one axis threshold** (an enabled gate
    with none would always skip); both are enforced by the shared `validatePipelineShape`
    at save, clone, and run start. A companion must now run **immediately after** an
    enabled producer it can review — `validatePipelineShape` enforces strict adjacency
    (over the enabled subset) on every facade, matching the builder, which surfaces
    companions as toggles attached to their producer. A pipeline that slips another step
    between a producer and its companion is rejected at save / clone / run start.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, no migration):** the `Pipeline` wire shape gains optional
  `gating`, `labels`, and `archived` fields, and `PipelineStep` gains `gating` /
  `skipped`. The built-in pipelines are unchanged in behaviour.

### Patch Changes

- 7d5e060: Bridge the Cloudflare ⇄ Node/local runtime feature-parity gaps: seven product
  features that worked on the Worker but `503`'d on the Node + local facades (their
  repositories were never wired) now work identically on all three, each landed with
  a cross-runtime conformance assertion.

  - **Merge threshold presets** — `merge_threshold_presets` + `DrizzleMergePresetRepository`.
  - **Board-scan repository blueprints** — `repo_blueprints` + `DrizzleRepoBlueprintRepository`
    (the blueprint reads; the `blueprints` pipeline step already ran on Node).
  - **Document sources** — `document_connections`/`documents` + repos; the Confluence /
    Notion / GitHub-docs provider shells are promoted into `@cat-factory/integrations`
    so both facades compose the same providers.
  - **Ephemeral environments** — `environment_connections`/`environments` + repos;
    `HttpEnvironmentProvider` promoted into `@cat-factory/integrations`; a Node
    `setInterval` TTL-teardown sweeper mirrors the Worker's expiry cron.
  - **GitHub projections + inline sync** — `github_branches`/`github_pull_requests`/
    `github_issues`/`github_commits`/`github_check_runs` + `github_sync_cursors` and the
    full read/write projection repos, so the runtime-neutral `GitHubSyncService`'s inline
    webhook/backfill ingest persists on Node; `WebCryptoWebhookVerifier` promoted into
    `@cat-factory/server`.
  - **Repo bootstrap** — `reference_architectures` + bootstrap runs stored as
    `kind='bootstrap'` rows of `agent_runs`; `ContainerRepoBootstrapper` promoted into
    `@cat-factory/server`; a **pg-boss durable bootstrap driver** (the analogue of the
    Worker's `BootstrapWorkflow`) replaces the previous "bootstrap isn't durable on Node
    yet" gap, and the stale-run sweeper now re-drives orphaned bootstrap runs too. The
    self-hosted runner pool (`RunnerPoolTransport`) now accepts the `bootstrap` dispatch
    kind — the harness `/bootstrap` route needs no Cloudflare primitive, so a pool runner
    serves it just like the local Docker transport — so a real bootstrap run dispatches +
    pushes for real on Node, not just on local.
  - **Prompt-fragment library (ADR 0006)** — `prompt_fragments`/`fragment_sources` +
    `DrizzlePromptFragmentRepository`/`DrizzleFragmentSourceRepository`; the runtime-neutral
    `LlmFragmentSelector` promoted into `@cat-factory/agents`. Opt-in via
    `PROMPT_LIBRARY_ENABLED`/`PROMPT_LIBRARY_SELECTOR`, wired exactly like the Worker's
    `selectFragmentLibraryDeps` (repos + installation resolver + selector), so the managed
    tenant fragment catalog feeding every agent run works identically on all three.

  The Worker keeps the same behaviour (it gains the new conformance assertions and the
  shared promoted classes). **Breaking on Node/local:** these features now require their
  new tables — boot-time `migrate()` applies them; there is no data to preserve.

  The Node/local Drizzle migration lineage was re-baselined to a single fresh
  `drizzle-kit generate` migration off the current `schema.ts` (the prior hand-authored
  folders had no snapshots, which blocked `db:generate`); `db:generate`/`db:check` are
  green again. Safe because no deployed database depends on the old lineage.

  Deferred (still Worker-only, flagged for follow-up): real-time push (Node `realtime`
  gateway still `501`s — needs a WebSocket hub over Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`),
  queue-backed async GitHub ingest (Node ingests inline rather than via a pg-boss queue),
  and GitHub rate-limit telemetry (Node keeps the no-op repository).
