### Patch Changes

- 7893f35: `/api/v1` can ADOPT a repository that already exists: `GET /api/v1/repos/available` lists what a
  workspace's connection can reach, and `POST /api/v1/repos/link` adopts one by name. Surface version
  1.44.0, additive.

  The hole they close was invisible from the surface. `GET /api/v1/repos` serves the repositories a
  workspace has LINKED, which is a set someone assembles in the app: linking is explicit per workspace,
  the provider webhook for an added repository does not project one, and a resync refreshes what is
  already linked rather than rediscovering the installation. So a repository that exists and is
  perfectly reachable is absent from every public read until a human opens the picker, and
  `POST /api/v1/services` answers 404 for its `repoId`, which is byte-for-byte what a caller gets for a
  repository that does not exist. A deployment could CREATE a repository through this API (1.41.0's
  bootstrap) and could not adopt one it already had.

  The two reads are a population pair rather than a duplicate, with `linked` as the join, so an absent
  repository is now diagnosable: reachable-but-unadopted appears in `/repos/available` with
  `linked: false`, and one that does not exist appears in neither. The adopt takes `owner`/`name`
  because a caller setting a workspace up from configuration knows the name and cannot know a provider
  id for a repository no public read lists; it is idempotent, answers the same row shape `/repos`
  serves (projected from the same read, so the two cannot disagree about whether a repository is free),
  and refuses an unreachable one with `404 repo_not_reachable`, a reason that covers "does not exist"
  and "your credential is not granted it" together because a provider answers those identically.
  `GitHubSyncService.linkRepoBySlug` resolves through the same path the app's own picker uses, and
  matches the OWNER as well as the name: a slug search can surface a look-alike, and linking that one
  would file a caller's work in someone else's account while answering 200.

  The acceptance suite uses them, which is what makes a hand-written `.env` a supported way in rather
  than a setup only `configure` could finish. Spec 01 adopts a repository the workspace does not hold
  instead of refusing; `target-repos` gates on REACHABILITY, point-reading `/repos/available` for
  anything unlinked and reporting "reachable but not adopted yet" as a pass; and `configure` adopts each
  repository rather than printing instructions for doing it by hand. Every attempt states its outcome,
  because a loop that reports only its positive answer is indistinguishable from one doing nothing, and
  what a refusal now asks for is only what no API can do: create the repository, and grant the
  credential access to it.

  Review follow-ups on the pair, all still inside 1.44.0 and still additive:

  Both rows now report whether a repository is SPOKEN FOR, from one account-scoped judgement.
  `/repos/available` publishes `serviceId` and `linkedElsewhere` exactly as `/repos` does, because a
  repository nobody here has linked can still back a service on another board of the account, and
  `POST /api/v1/services` refuses it either way. A discovery read that could not say so handed a
  caller a repository whose next call fails, and it was the acceptance gate that felt it first: it
  green-lit a pass that then died on the adopt, after the run the gate exists to precede. The
  judgement is now `PublicBoardReads.repoUse`, asked once of the projection (the repos list) and once
  of a batch of ids (the available read), so there is no second derivation to drift.

  The available read also publishes `truncated`. The provider legs behind it stop at a page cap and a
  search cap, so on a wide connection the rows are a prefix and a reachable repository can be missing
  from them, which is indistinguishable from the non-existence this read exists to diagnose. A
  point-read (`?q=owner/name`) resolves the exact slug directly and stays authoritative either way.

  A provider refusal is answered as one on BOTH operations and on either provider. The available read
  was left unwrapped, so a revoked credential or a rate limit on it arrived as `500 internal` rather
  than the documented 503/429; and the mapping recognised `GitHubApiError` alone, so a GitLab-connected
  workspace got that same `500` for a revoked token on both routes. Kernel now owns a `VcsApiError`
  base that both provider clients extend, which is the identity a consumer above the adapters branches
  on.

  The adopt is idempotent for a repository the credential can no longer reach: it resolves from what
  the workspace LINKS before consulting the provider, so a re-run no longer answers 404 for a
  repository `GET /api/v1/repos` still lists (a personal repository, or a narrowed App grant). And the
  link's `owner` accepts a namespace PATH, so a GitLab project under nested groups can be adopted at
  all: the available read published `group/subgroup` and the adopt refused it with a 422.

  In the suite, "the connection cannot reach it" is now recognised by `details.reason`, not by the 404
  alone: a deployment older than these endpoints answers an unmatched route with the same status, and
  reading that as "create the repository" sent an operator to create one they already had.

  Internal, breaking for in-repo callers only: `GitHubSyncService.listAvailableRepos` answers
  `{ repos, truncated }` rather than an array, the kernel `GitHubClient.searchInstallationRepos` port
  answers a `Paged` rather than an array (every adapter caps something, and a search that filters a
  bounded listing can return two rows and still be a prefix, which no row count reveals), and the
  `viewerRepos` / `patInstallationRepos` caches hold the whole page rather than its items (an
  enumeration that stopped at the cap is a prefix, and caching only the rows served that prefix to
  every later keystroke as the complete set).

### Minor Changes

- c0412e9: The acceptance suite now ADOPTS two repositories the operator created instead of bootstrapping
  them, and ships a `configure` command that assembles its `.env`.

  Bootstrapping was the one prerequisite no configuration could satisfy: a PAT connection reports
  `canCreateRepos: false` for every workspace and the App creation path is org-scoped, so on the
  deployment shape the suite's own README offers first, spec 01 could not run at all. It now backs a
  board service with each named repository (`POST /api/v1/services` already takes a `repoId`) and
  scaffolds both through `pl_build` from the same briefs, which also makes an interrupted scaffold
  resume the way an interrupted feature run does. `vcs-connection` stops asking for repository
  creation, `target-repos` gates on both repositories being visible AND adoptable, and a new
  `model-preset` check joins the pinned preset against the model catalog so an undispatchable preset
  is named as one rather than found at the first dispatch. Every task the suite files pins
  `ACCEPTANCE_MODEL_PRESET`, so a pass runs on the model it says it ran on.

  Adoptable is the stricter half of that gate, and it reads `linkedElsewhere` rather than only
  `serviceId`: a whole-repo service homed on another board of the account has no id a
  workspace-scoped surface can return, so the repository row answers `serviceId: null` with the flag
  set, and `POST /api/v1/services` refuses it. An existing link on this board is compared against the
  LEDGER's own service ids, so a resumed pass holding one of the two services cannot silently adopt a
  colleague's other one. The two repository blockers, a monorepo and a foreign home, are refused
  identically by the gate and by the adopt itself.

  `pnpm --filter @cat-factory/acceptance run configure` resolves what the deployment and the
  kubeconfig already know (workspace, connected account, preset library, apiserver, ServiceAccount
  token), asks for the API token and the two repository names, and opens each repository's creation
  page prefilled. It never overwrites a value without naming it and prints neither token.

  `@cat-factory/cli` gains four exports (`readApiServerCommand`, `readTokenCommand`, `decodeToken`,
  `normalizeApiServerUrl`) so the new command asks a kubeconfig the same questions `cat-factory k3s`
  does, and normalises the answer the same way: k3d writes the undialable wildcard bind address
  `https://0.0.0.0:6443` into a kubeconfig, so the read and its rewrite travel together.

  Internal break, as pre-1.0 internals may: a ledger from an earlier pass is not read for its
  `bootstrapJobs`, so a pass interrupted mid-bootstrap under the old shape starts fresh rather than
  re-attaching to a job.

### Patch Changes

- f6a1a87: Read the acceptance suite's configuration from a `.env` beside its vitest config. The file was
  already gitignored and referenced, but nothing loaded it, so a fully configured `.env` still
  refused with every variable reported as missing. A variable exported in the shell wins over the
  file, so a one-off `ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID=latest` still resumes.
