# @cat-factory/executor-harness

## 1.34.4

### Patch Changes

- b928904: Service connections Phase 2 — multi-env provisioning. A `deployer` step now fans out over
  the task's own service frame PLUS each connected involved-service frame, provisioning one
  ephemeral environment per frame (dispatched provider-before-consumer, parked between), each
  keyed per `(blockId, frameId)` so the fan-out no longer clobbers itself. Already-ready peers
  are injected into a later provision as `{{input.peerEnvUrls}}`, the agent context gains
  `involvedServices` (title + connection description + the peer's live env URL, read-time
  stale-filtered), and the Tester infra spec gains a `peerEnvironments` map so a cross-service
  integration test can reach a peer's real environment.

## 1.34.2

### Patch Changes

- 96cff56: Bump the bundled coding-agent CLIs in the executor-harness image (image tag
  1.34.0 -> 1.34.1): Claude Code `2.1.197 -> 2.1.199` and Codex `0.142.4 ->
0.142.5`. Pi stays at `0.80.3` (already the latest release). Routine upstream
  updates; no harness code changes. The matching image tag is bumped in
  `deploy/backend` (`wrangler.toml` + the `image:publish` script) and in
  `RECOMMENDED_HARNESS_IMAGE` (`backend/runtimes/local/src/harnessImage.ts`).

## 1.34.0

### Minor Changes

- b78adf5: Consume the job body's new `packageRegistries` field: validated against a hard host
  allowlist (`registry.npmjs.org`, `npm.pkg.github.com`; entries of an unknown
  ecosystem are dropped so future ecosystems stay additive; a token carrying a space
  or control character is rejected so it can't inject extra `~/.npmrc` lines), rendered
  into a 0600
  `~/.npmrc` before any mode runs (read by npm/pnpm/yarn v1 in the agent's shell
  installs and the frontend-infra stand-up alike), cleared when a job carries no
  entries so a reused warm-pool container never leaks a prior job's token, and the
  tokens registered with the shared output redaction. Yarn berry (`.yarnrc.yml`) and
  Docker-in-Docker compose image builds do not pick up the auth yet.

## 1.32.0

### Minor Changes

- eb67d40: Record per-call LLM telemetry for the Claude Code and Codex subscription harnesses,
  so their calls appear in the same `llm_call_metrics` store (and the "Model activity"
  observability panel) as the proxy-metered Pi harness.

  These harnesses talk direct to the vendor and bypass the LLM proxy, so the harness now
  lifts per-call metrics off each CLI's event stream: Claude Code (`stream-json --verbose`)
  carries full request/response bodies, per-turn tokens, model, and finish reason; Codex
  (`exec --json`) is thinner — flat assistant text plus per-turn token counts, with no
  request transcript (a CLI limitation). The executor records these into the SAME
  `LlmObservabilityService` the proxy uses (with zero per-HTTP timing, since the CLIs don't
  expose it), wired symmetrically on the Cloudflare and Node facades. Captured bodies are
  credential-scrubbed and honour the existing `LLM_RECORD_PROMPTS` switch. Telemetry is
  recorded on failed runs too (not only successful ones), so a token-spending run that
  ends with no changes / unusable output stays observable, and each row is minted a
  deterministic id off the job id so a durable-driver replay re-records idempotently.

  Also tightens `LLM_RECORD_PROMPTS`: it now empties the response and reasoning bodies as
  well as the prompt when recording is off (previously only the prompt was suppressed),
  so a deployment that opts out of retaining prompts no longer retains model replies
  either.

  Bumps the executor-harness runner image (harness `src/**` changed).

## 1.31.12

### Patch Changes

- 5ce03c6: Frontend UI-test stand-up: honor an optional `directory` on the frontend infra spec so a monorepo
  frontend builds/serves from its subdirectory (install, build, serve, and WireMock run there;
  `outputDir`/`mockMappingsPath` are relative to it). Bumps the runner image tag.

## 1.31.10

### Patch Changes

- 9577c4a: Fix a batch of native-mode (`LOCAL_NATIVE_AGENTS`) agent-harness bugs:

  - The harnesses (executor + deploy) now shut down gracefully on SIGTERM/SIGINT:
    every running job is aborted (`JobRegistry.abortAll`) so in-flight `claude`/
    `codex`/git/kubectl children are killed instead of being orphaned. Previously a
    dev-server restart left the agent CLI running unsupervised on the developer's
    login. The abort now targets the child's whole process group (POSIX), so the
    CLI's own grandchildren (a shell tool, a build, its git) die with it rather than
    reparenting to init. Shutdown exits as soon as the aborted jobs settle (capped at
    6s) instead of always waiting the fixed window. Both harness servers also honor a
    new `HARNESS_BIND_HOST` env, which the native transport sets to `127.0.0.1` so the
    unsandboxed agent-spawning API is no longer reachable from the LAN (containers keep
    binding all interfaces).
  - The native host-process transport sanitizes the harness child's environment to an
    allow-list (`LOCAL_HARNESS_ENV_ALLOW` extends it), so the orchestrator's secrets
    (DATABASE_URL, ENCRYPTION_KEY, GITHUB_PAT, provider keys) no longer leak into the
    ambient agent's env; the inline ambient CLI runner is sanitized the same way. The
    allow-list keeps the TLS trust-anchor vars (NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, SSL_CERT_FILE, ...)
    alongside the proxy vars, so a corporate TLS-terminating proxy still works. The
    deploy transport keeps full inheritance (kubectl/helm need ambient cluster env).
  - Process-lifecycle fixes in `LocalProcessRunnerTransport`: a harness that never
    becomes healthy is killed instead of leaking one process per retry, and
    `shutdown()` racing an in-flight lazy start now kills the child instead of
    resurrecting it. The local/Node graceful-shutdown path now invokes the
    container's `onShutdown`, which stops the native harnesses; that call is isolated
    in its own try so a failing pg-boss/pool teardown can't skip it.
  - `NativeRoutingRunnerTransport` no longer reports a blanket eviction for refs it
    doesn't know: after an orchestrator restart both `poll` and `release` fall back to
    the container leg (which re-finds a per-run container by label), so a still-running
    container job is re-attached / torn down instead of spuriously re-driven or leaked.
  - Config typos are no longer silent: unrecognized `LOCAL_NATIVE_AGENTS` tokens and
    an unrecognized/under-configured `LOCAL_DEPLOY_RUNTIME` now log a boot warning
    (behavior still fails safe).

## 1.31.8

### Patch Changes

- 6347d0e: Fix opaque "Failed to open PR (HTTP 422): No commits between ..." run failure when a
  coding run resumes a work branch that has nothing ahead of its base (e.g. its earlier PR
  was merged with a merge commit, leaving the branch reachable from base and its best-effort
  delete skipped).

  - `runCodingAgent` no longer treats a resumed branch as work unconditionally: when the
    branch has no new commits this pass, it confirms the branch is actually ahead of the PR
    base (new `branchAheadOfBase`, tri-state so an undeterminable result keeps the prior
    resume-is-work behaviour) and records a clean no-op otherwise.
  - `openPullRequest` now maps GitHub's `422 "No commits between ..."` to a no-op (returns
    `null`) instead of a hard `HarnessFailure`, as a backstop.

  Image-bumping: `@cat-factory/executor-harness` → 1.31.7 with the three runner-image pins
  synced.

## 1.31.6

### Patch Changes

- 9468b90: Force fully non-interactive git auth in the harness so native local mode never triggers a Git
  Credential Manager popup. Every git invocation now empties the host credential-helper list
  (`-c credential.helper=`) and disables interactive credential backends, so git falls back to the
  harness's own askpass PAT instead of the host's GCM — which on Windows either stole focus with a
  stray auth window or, when modal, hung the git command (clone/fetch/push) until it timed out. A
  per-command git timeout is now surfaced as an explicit stall (naming the likely causes) rather
  than a contentless "Command failed", and a genuine git failure now folds in git's stderr.

  Bumps the executor-harness image tag (and the matched `RECOMMENDED_HARNESS_IMAGE` pin) to 1.31.5.

## 1.31.4

### Patch Changes

- 986ed0e: Fix npm publish: add the `repository` field required by sigstore provenance

  The first publish of `@cat-factory/executor-harness` as a public package failed
  with `E422 … Error verifying sigstore provenance bundle: package.json:
"repository.url" is ""`. Provenance verification requires the package's
  `repository.url` to match the source repo, and the manifest carried no
  `repository` field at all. Add it (pointing at `backend/internal/executor-harness`,
  like every other published package) plus the mandatory `prepublishOnly` build
  guard so no publish path can ship an empty `dist/`.

## 1.31.2

### Patch Changes

- 063ef2b: Local native mode: default `LOCAL_HARNESS_ENTRY` to a bundled harness (no more manual path)

  Native execution (`LOCAL_NATIVE_AGENTS`) previously required `LOCAL_HARNESS_ENTRY` to be set
  to a filesystem path to the executor-harness server entry, which only existed inside a full
  monorepo checkout — so consumers installing `@cat-factory/*` from npm had no stable target.

  - `@cat-factory/executor-harness` is now **published** (was `private`). Its `.` export is the
    zero-dependency `dist/server.js` HTTP server that native mode spawns via `node <entry>`.
  - `@cat-factory/local-server` now depends on it and **auto-resolves** the entry via
    `require.resolve('@cat-factory/executor-harness')` when `LOCAL_HARNESS_ENTRY` is unset — so a
    fresh install runs native mode out of the box, mirroring how an unset `LOCAL_HARNESS_IMAGE`
    falls back to the pinned recommended image. Setting `LOCAL_HARNESS_ENTRY` still overrides it
    (for a custom or source-checkout build).
  - `cat-factory init` (`@cat-factory/cli`) no longer treats the entry as required: it is written
    commented (optional override) and the "set it before starting" warnings are gone.

- 063ef2b: Native local mode (Windows): make ephemeral agent-workspace teardown best-effort

  `withWorkspace` removed its temp checkout with a bare `rm` inside a `finally`. On Windows
  native execution (`LOCAL_NATIVE_AGENTS`) a just-exited child — git, or the developer's own
  `claude`/`codex` CLI — can still hold a transient handle on a file in the checkout, so the
  `rm` throws `EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rmdir '…/agent-XXXXXX'`. Running in the
  `finally`, that throw propagated out and failed an otherwise-successful agent step.

  Teardown is now resilient: it retries via `fs.rm`'s Windows backoff (`maxRetries`/
  `retryDelay`) and, if the directory still can't be removed, logs a warning and swallows the
  error. A leaked temp dir is harmless (the OS reclaims the temp root); failing the run is not.

## 1.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 71ec0a4: Harness `preview` mode — the long-lived browsable-serve mechanic (slice 5b of the
  frontend-preview + in-context UI-testing initiative, docs/initiatives/frontend-preview-ui-testing.md).

  A new `mode: 'preview'` on the generic agent job clones a `frontend` frame's branch and builds +
  serves the app with its other upstreams mocked using the SAME `standUpFrontend` the UI tester uses
  — but KEEPS IT RUNNING. No agent runs, and the serve / WireMock child processes are deliberately
  NOT torn down when the job returns, so the app stays reachable inside the container until the
  container itself is stopped (the transport's explicit stop path, wired in a later slice). The
  checkout is cloned into a directory that is NOT auto-removed (the ephemeral preview container
  reclaims it), since the served files must outlive the job.

  A preview that never comes up (failed build / server never bound) is a hard failure — unlike the
  tester's "test what you can" fallback — so the partial stand-up is torn down and its temp checkout
  removed, leaking neither processes nor disk. The `preview` result carries the in-container serve
  URL (the runtime publishes the serve port to a host port and forms the browsable URL from that).
  The success/failure boundary is a pure `buildPreviewOutcome` helper with unit coverage.

  Runner image bumped to 1.30.0 (the `src/**` change ships in the image consumed by local/node).

## 1.29.0

### Minor Changes

- e0aa45e: Self-contained frontend UI-test infra (slice 3 of the frontend-preview + in-context
  UI-testing initiative, docs/initiatives/frontend-preview-ui-testing.md).

  A `tester-ui` running on a task under a `type: 'frontend'` frame now builds and serves the
  frontend, stands WireMock up for its OTHER backend upstreams, and drives the UI tests against
  the two together — all as localhost processes in the one container (no Docker-in-Docker), so
  it works on Cloudflare and Apple `container` too.

  - **Harness**: a new `frontend` variant of the tester infra spec (`kind: 'frontend'`) that
    installs, builds (injecting the resolved backend URLs at build time, or a `window.env` shim
    for runtime injection), starts WireMock seeded from the frontend repo's mappings dir, serves
    the built app, health-checks it, and points the agent at it. The `ui` image gains pnpm/yarn
    (corepack), a static file server (`serve`), and a headless JRE + WireMock standalone
    (executor-harness image bumped to 1.28.0).
  - **Backend**: `AgentRunContext` carries a resolved `frontend` slice (the frame's
    `frontendConfig` plus its backend bindings resolved to concrete upstreams — a bound service's
    live ephemeral env URL for the service under test, else a WireMock mock). The engine's
    `testerInfraSpec` turns it into the harness spec, and the tester-infra start gate refuses a
    frontend UI test only when it binds a live-backend `service` with none actually live (a
    mock-only / no-backend frontend passes — WireMock + the static server fully stand it up).
    Empty-envVar bindings are filtered.
  - **Hardening** (review follow-ups): the harness's WireMock / serve child processes get an
    `'error'` listener (a spawn failure is captured, not an uncaught crash of the job server),
    WireMock is now health-checked alongside the served app (a dead mock becomes a prompt note,
    not a test-time ECONNREFUSED), reserved env-var names (`PATH`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, …) are dropped
    from the injected build env, and a configured `servePort` that collides with a reserved
    in-container port (8080 harness job server, 8089 WireMock) falls back to the default. The
    inspector's servePort placeholder now shows 4173. Shared `pathExists` / log-capture helpers
    are de-duplicated in the harness. The frontend UI-test gate's batch env read
    (`environmentRegistryRepository.listByWorkspace`) is added to the mothership remote-persistence
    allow-list so the gate resolves in mothership mode.
  - **Hardening (second review round)**: the frontend stand-up now feeds the run's inactivity
    watchdog with a heartbeat while it installs/builds/serves — a real frontend's `install` +
    `build` can exceed the 10-min inactivity window, and the (activity-silent) stand-up would
    otherwise be killed mid-build with a misleading "likely hung". `serveMode: 'command'` now also
    forwards the resolved backend URLs (`env`) to the serve process, so a runtime-reading
    dev/preview server sees them (previously only `PORT` was passed). Reserved env-var names are
    now also dropped in the backend infra-spec builder (defence in depth, not just the harness).
    The `mockMappingsPath` docs + inspector hint clarify WireMock's `--root-dir` layout (stubs go
    in a `mappings/` subfolder), and the env-injection hint notes the build-tool prefix caveat
    (e.g. Vite only exposes `VITE_*`). The UI-tester prompt flags a live-backend CORS failure as an
    infra gap rather than an app defect.
  - **Hardening (third review round)**: the frontend stand-up now runs in the run's SERVICE
    SUBTREE (`workDir`), not the clone root — a monorepo frontend's `package.json` / `outputDir` /
    `mocks/` live under its own subdirectory, so installing, building, serving and seeding WireMock
    from the repo root would have targeted the wrong directory (the docker-compose stand-up still
    runs at the root, where its repo-relative `composePath` resolves). The harness now bounds
    frontend `servePort` / `wiremockPort` to 1..65535 at its untrusted-body boundary (an
    out-of-range port can never bind, so it falls back to the default). The reserved-env filter —
    in BOTH the harness parse and the backend infra-spec builder — grows the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
    / `BASH_ENV` / `ENV` / `SHELL` / `IFS` names plus the `npm_config_*` and `GIT_*` FAMILIES, so a
    binding that reconfigures the package manager, git, or the TLS trust store during the build is
    dropped rather than injected. Runtime env injection under `serveMode: 'command'` now warns
    (the `window.env` shim is only served in static mode; the forwarded `env` covers the command
    server), and a failed shim write is logged instead of silently swallowed. `AgentContextBuilder`
    gains `resolveServiceFrame` so the frontend-config resolution reuses the frame row the walk
    already loaded instead of re-fetching it. Fixes the `Lint & format` failure (an unnecessary
    `?? {}` empty-fallback spread in the serve env).
  - **Hardening (fourth review round)**: the reserved-env family filter (`npm_config_*` / `GIT_*`)
    now matches **case-insensitively** in BOTH the harness parse and the backend infra-spec builder —
    npm reads its config env with a case-insensitive `/^npm_config_/i`, so `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`
    (upper/mixed case) is honoured just like `npm_config_registry`; a case-sensitive prefix match
    would have let the upper-cased form slip through and reconfigure the package manager during the
    build. The frontend serve/WireMock health-check now also aborts an in-flight probe on the run's
    own abort signal (not just the per-attempt timeout). The stale `envInjectionHint` translation is
    synced across all locales, and the missed-translation class is now guarded in CI (see the app
    note). The agent prompt-note assembly and the frontend `installCommand` are extracted as pure
    helpers with unit coverage.

  `@cat-factory/app`: sync the `envInjectionHint` hint across all locales (the `en` update noting
  the build-tool prefix caveat, e.g. Vite only exposes `VITE_*`, had been left untranslated). A new
  CI **locale-parity guard** now fails a PR that changes an `en.json` message key without changing
  the same key in every other locale, so translations can't silently go stale.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0): the harness `AgentInfraSpec` is now a discriminated union
  (`service` | `frontend`); the default backend-service tester shape is unchanged.

## 1.27.6

### Patch Changes

- fb53662: Recover and surface stalled runs instead of letting them spin `running` forever.

  A run whose durable driver was lost (a crashed/restarted orchestrator that left its
  pg-boss advance job orphaned-`active`) previously stayed `running` indefinitely with no
  error: the Node stale-run sweeper's re-`send` is a silent no-op while the `exclusive`
  singleton is still held, so the run was never recovered or flagged.

  - **Sweeper now reclaims orphaned advance jobs.** It classifies each stale run's advance
    job by pg-boss's own heartbeat (`live` / `orphaned` / `missing`); an orphaned job (dead
    worker, frozen heartbeat) is deleted to free its singletonKey before re-driving, so a
    bare re-send no longer no-ops onto a dead job. Runs on boot too (immediate reconcile),
    not just on the interval.
  - **Hard-stall backstop.** A run orphaned past a deadline (`STALE_RUN_HARD_FAIL_MINUTES`,
    default 60) that recovery can't resume is failed with the new `stalled`
    `AgentFailureKind` — surfaced by the existing failure banner + retry (a new "Run stalled"
    title) instead of spinning silently. Symmetric on the Cloudflare cron sweeper.
  - **Orphaned local containers are reaped at boot** — a still-running per-run container
    whose run has since gone terminal/away (its `release()` never ran) is removed, via a new
    `AgentRunRepository.liveRunIds` batch query + a `ContainerRuntimeAdapter.listRunContainers`.
  - **Harness structured-repair retries transient failures.** The last-ditch structured-output
    repair call now retries HTTP 429 / 5xx / network errors with exponential backoff honoring
    `Retry-After`, so a transient rate-limit no longer turns a recoverable parse into a hard
    `no structured result` run failure. (executor-harness image bumped to 1.27.5.)

  Breaking (internal): `AgentRunRepository.listStale` now returns `StaleAgentRun` (adds
  `updatedAt`) and gains `liveRunIds`; both D1 and Drizzle repos implement them.

## 1.27.4

### Patch Changes

- b744822: Stop sending `temperature` on the structured-output repair call so it works on Anthropic's newest models.

  When an agent's final JSON reply didn't parse, the harness made a one-shot "structured repair" call that hard-coded `temperature: 0`. Anthropic's newest models (Opus 4.7+ and the Claude 5 family) have **removed** the sampling parameters and reject any of them with `400 invalid_request_error: temperature is deprecated for this model` — so on Claude Opus 4.8 via the claude-code subscription harness the repair itself failed, and the run died with `Implementation failed: the agent produced no structured result … [structured repair did not help (subscription repair call failed: HTTP 400 …)]`.

  The repair prompt already constrains the output to JSON-only, so determinism via `temperature=0` isn't needed. Both repair bodies (the LLM-proxy path and the Anthropic-compatible subscription path) now omit `temperature` entirely, which is valid on every current and future model regardless of provider.

## 1.27.2

### Patch Changes

- 93e432b: Bump the bundled coding-agent CLIs in the executor-harness image (image tag
  1.27.0 -> 1.27.1): Pi `0.79.8 -> 0.80.3`, Claude Code `2.1.195 -> 2.1.197`
  and Codex `0.142.3 -> 0.142.4`. Routine upstream updates; no harness code
  changes. The matching image tag is bumped in `deploy/backend` (`wrangler.toml`
  - the `image:publish` script).

## 1.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 915861c: Surface the Tester's in-container docker-compose dependency stand-up logs on the test report
  window.

  A `local`-infra Tester stands the service's dependencies up inside its container with
  `docker compose up --wait` before running. Until now that command's output was written only
  to the harness's own logs — so when the dependencies failed to come up (a port clash, an
  image pull-auth failure, a healthcheck timeout, a service that exits immediately) the run
  showed an opaque failure and the single highest-signal artifact for diagnosing it was
  unreachable from the UI. This was flagged as the natural follow-up to the container-lifecycle
  observability work (the orchestrator-side provisioning logs can't see it — the stand-up runs
  _inside_ the container).

  - **Harness.** `standUpInfra` now captures the `docker compose up` stdout+stderr (on success
    _and_ failure), redacts credentials (the shared `redact` now also scrubs credential-named
    `KEY=value` / `KEY: value` assignments — e.g. a dependency echoing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=…` —
    which are neither a token shape nor a known value), tail-bounds it, and returns an
    `infraSetup` record
    (started / compose path / duration / logs / error) on the agent result.
  - **Propagation.** The record rides the existing `RunnerJobResult` → `AgentRunResult` path
    (forwarded verbatim by both transports) and the engine persists it on the Tester step as
    `step.test.infraSetup`, refreshed on each Tester round.
  - **UI.** The test report window's Infrastructure section now shows a "Dependency stand-up"
    panel — the outcome, the compose file, how long it took, the verbatim error on failure, and
    the captured stand-up logs behind a toggle.
  - **Parity.** The cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the record round-trips onto
    `step.test.infraSetup` identically on D1 and Postgres.

  Bumps the `@cat-factory/executor-harness` image to `1.26.0` (the harness `src/` changed) and
  the matching tag in `deploy/backend`.

## 1.25.0

### Minor Changes

- 48a3df6: Surface the per-run container's live lifecycle in a container agent's details, and bring
  the API Tester window to parity with the Coder.

  Previously a container-backed step showed a "Spinning up container…" badge that simply
  **vanished** once the container was up, leaving a blank "working" state — you couldn't tell
  whether the agent was still preparing the checkout or already making model calls, and there
  was no way to see which container the run was on or whether it was up / errored / gone.

  - **Live phase.** The executor-harness now exposes its current lifecycle phase
    (`starting` → `clone` → `agent` → `push`) on the running job view — the same marker that
    already drove the stuck-run breadcrumb. The engine threads it through
    (`RunnerJobView` / `AgentJobUpdate`) onto the step so the details show WHAT the container
    is doing: "Preparing workspace" vs "Agent running" vs "Pushing changes".
  - **Container identity + address.** The transport now attaches the container's id (the
    Cloudflare Durable Object id; the local Docker container id) and, where one exists, its
    reachable URL (the local host URL) — so a run's details name WHERE it runs.
  - **Explicit lifecycle status.** Steps carry a `container` projection
    (`starting` / `up` / `errored`, with `destroyed` derived once the run's container is
    reclaimed), so the details say whether the container is spinning up, running, errored, or
    gone — instead of inferring it from a run-level failure.
  - **API Tester parity.** The Tester result window now reuses the same observability the
    Coder's step detail shows — the container lifecycle (status / phase / id / url), the
    ephemeral environment status, and the run's infrastructure attempts + logs — alongside its
    test report, instead of the report alone. The Tester (and the human-test / visual-confirm
    gate helpers) now surface the cold-boot `starting` window before the agent comes up, like
    the Coder, rather than jumping straight to "running".
  - **The legacy `startingContainer` boolean is removed** in favour of the richer `container`
    projection everywhere (no dual-signal path): every container-backed step — including the
    gate helpers — now reports its lifecycle through `container`. (Stale persisted steps simply
    drop the field; backwards compatibility is a non-goal.)

  Bumps the `@cat-factory/executor-harness` image to `1.24.0` (and the matching tag in
  `deploy/backend`).

## 1.23.0

### Minor Changes

- 29d8b5d: Harness error handling & observability: structured failure cause, stuck-run diagnosis, and transient API retry.

  - **Structured failure cause.** The executor-harness now reports a structured `failureCause`
    (`inactivity-timeout` | `max-duration` | `agent` | `git` | `api` | `no-usable-output` |
    `no-changes`) and an extended `detail` on a failed job view, alongside the existing one-line
    `error`. The backend prefers the structured cause to classify a failure (→ `AgentFailureKind`
    / `BootstrapFailureKind`) and falls back to the existing error-string regex when it's absent
    (older image, or a manifest pool that doesn't map the cause), so the change is backward
    compatible. The fallback now matches the bootstrap path's regex on BOTH the agent and
    bootstrap paths (a watchdog timeout classifies as `timeout`, not a generic `agent`). A `git`
    operation or an upstream `api` call that fails carries its real cause rather than `agent`.
    The Node/self-hosted runner pool forwards the structured cause/detail too (new optional
    `failureCausePath`/`detailPath` on the pool response manifest), so it isn't Cloudflare-only.
    Container eviction stays facade-detected (the harness never emits the eviction marker). The
    watchdog phrases are centralized so they can't drift from the regex that still reads them.
  - **Stuck-run diagnosis.** An inactivity kill now reports which phase was hung and the last tool
    that ran (e.g. "...likely hung in agent phase; last tool bash 40s ago"), with a per-phase
    timing breakdown in `detail` and on the failure log. A per-job child logger binds the run's
    correlation fields (jobId/repo/branch/kind) onto every line.
  - **Transient API retry.** Opening a PR/MR now retries a transient upstream failure (5xx / 429 /
    network) with bounded, abort-aware exponential backoff (honoring `Retry-After`), so a momentary
    blip no longer fails an otherwise-complete run. The 422/409 "already exists" success paths are
    unaffected.
  - **Surfaced silent degradation.** Checkpoint-push failures, dropped follow-up lines, malformed
    Pi JSONL records, and SIGKILL escalation are now logged at warn with counts instead of being
    swallowed. A final non-newline-terminated Pi event is flushed so its progress/span isn't lost.

  Bumps the `@cat-factory/executor-harness` image to `1.22.0` (and the matching tag in
  `deploy/backend`).

## 1.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 2961b05: Meaningfully widen GitLab support in local mode — a `GITLAB_PAT` deployment now drives the
  real agent workflow, not just sign-in:

  - **`@cat-factory/gitlab`** adds `asGitHubClient(...)`, a `VcsClient`→`GitHubClient` adapter so
    any provider-neutral VCS client (e.g. `FetchGitLabClient`) satisfies the legacy `GitHubClient`
    port the engine's CI gate, merger and repo-read paths still consume.
  - **`@cat-factory/server`** resolves a run's repo origin (clone URL + provider) through an
    injectable `resolveRepoOrigin` seam and stamps the provider onto the dispatched job, instead
    of hardcoding a `github.com` clone URL. The default stays GitHub, so the Worker/Node facades
    are unchanged; a GitLab deployment supplies a GitLab origin so containers clone the right host
    and open merge requests. Without this the clone URL was always github.com, so a GitLab repo
    could never be cloned by an agent container.
  - **`@cat-factory/node-server`** threads `resolveRepoOrigin` through `NodeContainerOptions` to
    the container executor (default GitHub), so a sibling facade can supply a GitLab origin.
  - **`@cat-factory/local-server`** wires a GitLab PAT symmetrically to the GitHub PAT: the agent
    containers' git clone/push token falls back to `GITLAB_PAT`; the CI gate, mergeability, real
    merge and repo-link flows read through a PAT-backed `FetchGitLabClient` (adapted to
    `GitHubClient`); the agent containers clone the configured GitLab host + open merge requests
    (via `resolveRepoOrigin`); and the GitLab host is added to the harness clone/push allow-list
    (`GITHUB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) so the container doesn't reject the GitLab clone URL. A GitLab-only
    local deployment is now a first-class source-control backend. Set `GITLAB_API_BASE` for a
    self-managed instance. The boot warning and the cross-provider `vcs-conformance` test cover
    both providers.
  - **`@cat-factory/executor-harness`** opens a GitLab **merge request** (not a GitHub PR) when the
    job's `repo.provider` is `gitlab` (set authoritatively by the server, so a self-managed GitLab
    on an arbitrarily-named host is routed correctly), falling back to host inference from the
    clone URL. The REST base + project path are derived from the host, and an already-open MR is
    reused on a resumed run. The GitHub path is unchanged. (The runner image must be republished
    for this to take effect in a deployed worker.)

## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 32c653f: Add a dedicated UI-tester image definition (`Dockerfile.ui`) for the `tester-ui` agent kind:
  it layers Playwright + Chromium on top of the slim base executor image, so the browser is
  isolated to the one kind that needs it and never bloats every other agent's cold-start. A
  transport routes a job to this image when the dispatch option `image: 'ui'` is set. The base
  image is unchanged. NOTE: the per-runtime routing into this image (a second Cloudflare
  container class; image-per-step on the self-hosted-pool / local Docker transports) is the
  remaining deploy-time step — the `image: 'ui'` dispatch seam is in place.

## 1.19.2

### Patch Changes

- b5231b0: Make prompt-caching a first-class, visible capability and add per-kind progress-guard
  leniency.

  **Caching capability + observability.** `providerCachePolicy` moves to the kernel
  (`domain/cache-policy.ts`, re-exported from `@cat-factory/agents`) so the model catalog
  can derive a per-flavour `ModelOption.cachesPrompts` from the effective provider — the
  same model reads `false` on its cache-less Cloudflare/Workers-AI flavour and `true` once
  a direct key upgrades it to its caching `direct` flavour. The already-recorded
  `cachedPromptTokens` is now aggregated per agent kind in `summarizeByExecution` (D1 +
  Drizzle, kept symmetric) and surfaced as `cachedPromptTokens` + a derived `cacheHitRate`
  on the step rollup and the LLM-metrics export.

  **Vendor-selection UI.** The model picker shows a `Prompt caching` / `No prompt caching`
  badge per flavour, the API-keys panel notes which direct keys enable caching, and the
  step metrics bar shows a cached-token split when present — so a user can see (and act on)
  the hot path running cache-less. Shipped model defaults are intentionally NOT changed;
  extending `providerCachePolicy` to more providers (Moonshot / OpenRouter / LiteLLM) is
  gated on benchmark evidence (see `backend/docs/prompt-caching.md`).

  **Per-kind guard leniency.** The container progress guard can now be loosened per agent
  kind via an optional `guardLimits` job-body field (clamped per knob in the harness;
  merged over the env/built-in defaults — loosen-only, never tighten). A data-driven
  `agentTuningFor` seam (`@cat-factory/agents`, plus an `AgentKindDefinition.tuning` hook
  for custom kinds) supplies the profile, which `ContainerAgentExecutor` folds into the
  dispatch body. Initial profiles give `conflict-resolver` more error headroom and the
  research-heavy kinds a higher consecutive-web cap, so a legitimately-progressing run is
  not killed for its normal pattern. Output-token ceilings are unchanged.

## 1.19.1

### Patch Changes

- ae7bfcd: Bump the bundled subscription-mode CLIs in the executor-harness image (image tag
  1.18.0 -> 1.19.0): Claude Code `2.1.193 -> 2.1.195` and Codex `0.142.2 -> 0.142.3`.
  Routine upstream patch updates; no harness code changes. The matching image tag is
  bumped in `deploy/backend` (`wrangler.toml` + the `image:publish` script).

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 17adf4c: Local mode: warm container pool + checkout reuse, and optional native (host-process)
  execution of the developer's installed Claude Code / Codex CLI.

  **Warm pool + persistent checkout (default off = unchanged):** the local runner transport
  can keep idle harness containers warm and lease one — preferring a member that already holds
  the run's repo — instead of cold-starting a container per run. A leased member reuses a
  stable per-repo checkout (`git reset --hard` + a keep-list clean sweep that preserves
  dependency caches like `node_modules`, then `fetch` + switch branch) rather than cloning from
  scratch. New harness job field `persistentCheckout` drives this; it is set only by the local
  pool transport, so every other runtime keeps the ephemeral fresh-clone path byte-for-byte.
  Pooling is Docker-family only (the new `capabilities.pooling`); Apple `container` keeps the
  per-run path.

  **Configured in the UI + DB, not env:** the warm-pool sizing (size / pre-warm / max / idle
  timeout) and the per-repo checkout-reuse knobs (workspace root + dep-cache keep list) are a
  new per-deployment singleton (`local_settings`, Postgres/Drizzle only — local-mode-only, so
  no D1 mirror) exposed through a dedicated **"Local mode"** settings panel
  (Integrations → Local mode), served by a new `GET|PUT /local-settings` controller wired only
  on the local facade (503 elsewhere). This REPLACES the env vars `LOCAL_POOL_SIZE`,
  `LOCAL_POOL_MIN_WARM`, `LOCAL_POOL_MAX`, `LOCAL_POOL_IDLE_TTL_MS`, `HARNESS_WORKSPACE_ROOT`,
  `HARNESS_CLEAN_KEEP` (no longer read). The container transport forwards the checkout knobs to
  the harness container as `HARNESS_*` env. Breaking: those env vars are dropped — set the
  values in the UI instead.

  **Native execution (`LOCAL_NATIVE_AGENTS`, default off):** an allow-list of subscription
  harnesses (`claude-code,codex`) to run as a host process (new `LocalProcessRunnerTransport`)
  driving the developer's OWN installed `claude` / `codex` CLI with its ambient login (new
  harness `ambientAuth` mode) — no leased credential, no personal-credential gate for those
  vendors. Native applies ONLY to a listed harness's NATIVE vendor (Anthropic `claude` /
  OpenAI `codex`): a non-native vendor that reuses the `claude-code` harness (GLM/Kimi/DeepSeek
  carries its own base URL) and proxy/`pi` models are NOT run unsandboxed on the host — they
  keep the sandboxed per-run container path (so they still lease their real credential and
  still need `LOCAL_HARNESS_IMAGE`). Gated, local-facade-only, with the explicit no-sandbox /
  own-subscription trade documented. Requires `LOCAL_HARNESS_ENTRY`. The Tester's local
  docker-compose infra is reported unsupported in native mode for now (host-compose +
  git-worktree isolation are a follow-up phase).

  Breaking: none (all paths default off). The executor-harness image is bumped (1.16.0) for
  the new `persistentCheckout` / `ambientAuth` handling.

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 81b60d4: Add the future-looking **Follow-up companion** to the Coder agent.

  As the Coder works it now surfaces forward-looking items — genuine loose ends, useful
  side-tasks it is deliberately not acting on, and clarifying questions — by appending them
  to a `.cat-follow-ups.jsonl` sentinel file in its working directory. The executor-harness
  tails that file and streams the items **out** on the job view (drain-on-read, like tool
  spans), so a blinking **Follow-up companion** chip on the Coder step lights up the moment
  the first item appears — while the container is still running.

  A human triages each item at any point: file a follow-up as a tracker issue (GitHub Issues
  / Jira, via the existing `TicketTrackerProvider`), send it back to the Coder to address
  after delivering the key task, answer a question, or dismiss it. The pipeline's following
  steps do not start until **every** item is decided: an undecided follow-up or unanswered
  question parks the run at the Coder's completion (a new `followup_pending` notification).
  Once all are decided the engine loops the Coder for the queued / answered items (within a
  per-step budget) before advancing. The companion is enabled by default on Coder steps and
  disableable per step in the pipeline builder.

  This is pure engine + run-step state (no new table) so it is runtime-symmetric across the
  Cloudflare and Node facades — the cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the park →
  decide → loop → advance behaviour on both. Wire contracts (`followUpItem` /
  `followUpsStepState`, the `followup_pending` notification, the `follow-ups` result view),
  the `streamFollowUps` harness job flag + `RunnerJobView.followUps` channel (with an
  optional pool-manifest `followUpsPath`), and the `FOLLOW_UP_GUIDANCE` Coder prompt fragment
  are added across the stack.

  Bumps the executor-harness image (new src) — publish + redeploy to roll it out.

## 1.15.4

### Patch Changes

- 7cfab01: Harden the executor-harness image + runner (image bump 1.15.2 -> 1.15.3):

  - **Pin the base image by digest.** Both Dockerfile stages now pin
    `node:26-trixie-slim` to its multi-arch index digest
    (`sha256:a1d9d671…`) instead of the mutable tag, so two builds of the same
    Dockerfile always resolve the identical base (supply-chain / reproducibility).
    The human-readable tag is kept in the line for context; bump both stages
    together via `docker buildx imagetools inspect node:26-trixie-slim`.
  - **Consolidate credential redaction into one module (`src/redact.ts`).**
    Previously the git/runner paths applied only the pattern-based scrub (URL
    userinfo + GitHub token shapes) and the subscription paths applied only the
    value-based scrub (the leased token + harvested JSON leaves), on disjoint error
    paths — so a secret only one rule caught could leak on the other. The single
    `redact(text, knownSecrets?)` now applies BOTH rules in one pass everywhere.
  - **Watchdog headroom.** Derive the per-git-command timeout (`GIT_TIMEOUT_MS`) from
    the configured inactivity watchdog — a fixed 3-min margin below it, floored — instead
    of a constant racing it. Git emits no activity events while it runs, so an equal
    threshold made a slow clone/push fail with the misleading "no agent activity … likely
    hung" reason; git now always loses the race and surfaces its own accurate "git timed
    out". Deriving it (rather than hardcoding 7 min against the 10-min default) keeps the
    invariant intact even when an operator lowers `JOB_INACTIVITY_MS`. The invariant is
    documented on both constants.
  - **Shared `killChildProcess` helper (`src/process.ts`).** Extract the identical
    SIGTERM→(5s)→SIGKILL escalation that the Pi and subscription CLI runners each
    re-implemented, so the kill strategy has a single source of truth.

## 1.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 542ee0c: Update the bundled subscription harnesses to their latest versions: Claude Code
  `2.1.191` → `2.1.193` and Codex `0.142.0` → `0.142.2`. These change the runner
  image, so the image tag is bumped in `deploy/backend` (`image:publish` +
  `wrangler.toml`) accordingly.

## 1.15.1

### Patch Changes

- 18f6b3b: Security hardening across three surfaces.

  Local-runner SSRF: the server-side fetches to a user-supplied runner base URL (the "Test
  connection" probe and the run-time LLM proxy forward) now follow redirects manually and
  re-validate every hop against the loopback/LAN allow-list, so a reachable runner can no
  longer `302` the server into the cloud-metadata endpoint or a public host. `localRunnerUrlError`
  also rejects URLs with embedded credentials. New `fetchLocalRunner` helper in
  `@cat-factory/integrations`.

  Harness inbound auth: the Cloudflare container transport now sends the `x-harness-secret`
  header and injects `HARNESS_SHARED_SECRET` into each per-run container's env when the secret
  is configured, matching the harness server and the local Docker transport. Unset leaves the
  harness open as before (it is only reachable via DO-internal addressing). The self-hosted
  runner pool reaches the harness through its own control plane, so its secret is configured
  pool-side.

  GitHub API requests in the executor harness now build the PR-lookup query with
  `URLSearchParams` and encode the owner/name path segments, so a branch or owner containing
  `&`/`#` can't split the query or inject a parameter.

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- be182e8: Hybrid linked-context delivery to agents, and deterministic reference resolution.

  Linked documents and tracker issues now reach a container agent as a cheap in-prompt
  summary index plus their full bodies materialised into a `.cat-context/` directory in the
  checkout (kept out of the agent's commits via a local git exclude), so the agent reads only
  what it needs on demand — replacing the previous 280-char document excerpt. Inline (no-
  checkout) agent kinds instead get the budgeted full body injected into the prompt.

  The engine also resolves references named explicitly in a block's description or its
  incorporated requirements (Jira keys like `PROJ-123`, fully-qualified GitHub `owner/repo#123`,
  and URLs) against the already-imported corpus, folding those high-confidence items into the
  context set. Each reference is resolved by a **point lookup** (a keyed `get`, or a new
  `getByUrl` repository method) rather than scanning the whole workspace corpus per step. Bare
  `#123` refs are intentionally not resolved: a workspace can hold many repos, so a bare number
  is ambiguous — name the issue as `owner/repo#123` (or by URL) to pull it in. There is no
  speculative relationship graph and no live fetching: everything is prepared backend-side,
  which is required because the container harness cannot reach Jira/Confluence/GitHub itself.

  Documents gain a `content_hash` column (D1 + Drizzle) so a re-import whose body AND title/url
  are unchanged is a no-op, preserving the existing projection and block link; a renamed/moved
  page still re-projects.

  Breaking (pre-1.0): `AgentRunContext.block.contextDocs` items now carry `summary` + `body`,
  `contextTasks` items carry `summary`, and `DocumentRecord` carries `contentHash`. The
  `DocumentRepository`/`TaskRepository` ports gain a `getByUrl` method (implemented on both the
  D1 and Drizzle stores). The executor-harness image gains an optional `contextFiles` job field;
  bump the runner image tag.

## 1.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 494fb34: Finish the Task-5 strangler: migrate the last two built-in agents (conflict-resolver and
  repo bootstrap) onto the single, manifest-driven `agent` harness kind, then delete every
  bespoke per-kind handler and collapse the dispatch surface. The harness is now a generic
  LLM-over-a-checkout runner with **one** kind — WHAT each agent does is decided entirely by
  the backend and carried as job data.

  **conflict-resolver** now dispatches `kind: 'agent'` `mode: 'coding'` with a `mergeBase`
  (full clone of the PR branch). `handleAgent`'s coding flow merges `origin/<mergeBase>` in to
  surface the conflicts, leads the prompt with the actual conflict hunks it discovers, then
  completes the merge commit and pushes back onto the same branch (no new PR) — refusing to
  push a half-resolved tree. Routed through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody`; the bespoke
  `/resolve-conflicts` body + handler are gone.

  **bootstrap** now dispatches `kind: 'agent'` `mode: 'coding'` with a `bootstrap` spec
  (`{ target, reference?, reinit, forcePush, fromScratch? }`). `handleAgent` clones the
  reference architecture (or scaffolds from an empty dir), runs the agent, guards against a
  no-op, then force-pushes a fresh single-commit history to the separate target repo's default
  branch (lifted `reinitAndPush` / `producedRepoContent`). `ContainerRepoBootstrapper` builds
  the generic body; its `linkRepoToBlock` post-op already lives in `pollBootstrapJob`.

  **Harness cleanup (image bump).** Deleted the bespoke handlers (`blueprint`/`spec`/`explore`/
  `merger`/`on-call`/`tester`/`ci-fixer`/`fixer`/`conflict-resolver`/`bootstrap`/`handleRun`),
  collapsed `server.ts`'s `KINDS` to `{ agent }`, and stripped the bespoke job types + parsers
  from `job.ts` (keeping `parseAgentJob` + the shared helpers + `BootstrapTargetSpec`). The
  executor-harness image is bumped (1.13.0 → 1.14.0; deploy tag + `wrangler.toml`).

  **Kernel (breaking, pre-1.0).** `RunnerDispatchKind` collapses to the single member
  `'agent'`, and `RunnerJobResult` is slimmed to `prUrl` / `branch` / `summary` / `error` /
  `defaultBranch` / `pushed` / `custom` / `usage` (the per-kind `service`/`spec`/`assessment`/
  `onCallAssessment`/`report`/`resolved` channels are removed — every structured agent returns
  its doc on `custom`, coerced kind-aware in `toRunResult`). The transports default to
  `kind: 'agent'`; the runner-pool result coercion passes only `custom` through.

  Two fixes ride along. (1) `toRunResult` now surfaces an opened PR (`prUrl`) **before** the
  in-place-fixer `pushed` branch — the migrated coder returns BOTH `pushed: true` and `prUrl`,
  so the previous ordering silently dropped its structured `pullRequest` (the worker test only
  passed because its fake omitted `pushed`). (2) The local transport ran the per-run container
  privileged off `kind === 'test'`, which never matched after the tester migration; the
  container is per-RUN (created by the run's first step, not the tester), so it now runs
  privileged whenever `privilegedTestJobs` is enabled (gated by the `localDind` capability).

## 1.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 7d1f829: Migrate the `tester` built-in agent onto the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness kind,
  continuing the Task-5 strangler (after the read-only kinds, the merger/on-call/fixers, the
  coder, blueprints, and spec-writer).

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now routes `tester` through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody` →
  `buildRegisteredAgentBody` as a read-only `mode: 'explore'` structured agent that clones the PR
  head branch (it makes NO commits) instead of the bespoke `/test` body. The agent returns ONLY
  its structured JSON report; `toRunResult` coerces that `custom` result into the `testReport`
  channel the engine's `TesterController` greenlights-or-loops the fixer on. The conservative
  coercion the harness `/test` handler used to apply — defaulting every field safely and honouring
  a greenlight ONLY when no blocking (high/critical) concern is open — now runs backend-side in
  `coerceTestReport` (and the engine re-applies it defensively). The role prompt and the
  run-mode / ephemeral-URL guidance come from the standard `roleSystemPrompt` + `userPromptFor`,
  which already carry them, so the harness adds none.

  The tester needs its docker-compose dependencies stood up for the run, so the generic
  `agent` explore flow grows an optional `infra` spec (`{ environment, noInfraDependencies?,
composePath?, environmentUrl? }`): `handleAgent`'s explore mode stands the local
  docker-compose infra up before the agent runs and tears it down afterward (lifted from the
  bespoke tester handler), folding a stand-up-failure note into the prompt so a missing Docker
  daemon is non-fatal. An `ephemeral` run manages no infra (the env is already deployed and its
  URL reaches the agent through its prompt). This is a harness `src/**` change, so the
  executor-harness image is bumped (1.13.0; deploy tag + `wrangler.toml`).

  Two regressions the migration introduced are fixed here. (1) The report's `environment` (which
  env the suite ran in, echoed to the UI) was authoritatively set from the task config by the old
  `/test` handler; the migrated `coerceTestReport` only read it from the model's JSON, so it was
  near-always dropped. The harness now stamps `environment` onto the structured result from the
  job's `infra` spec (the authoritative source), so it's deterministic again regardless of what the
  model emits. (2) A `local` service with no infra dependencies lost the precise "nothing was stood
  up — run the suite directly" guidance and was told its infra had been stood up on localhost;
  `testerEnvironmentSection` now restores the no-dependencies run-mode line for those services.

  The dead `/test` harness handler (and the other migrated kinds' handlers) is removed in the
  later harness-cleanup sweep. The cross-runtime conformance suite already covers the generic
  `agent` explore + structured-result path on both runtimes.

## 1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 77b7d31: Migrate the `spec-writer` built-in agent onto the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness
  kind, continuing the Task-5 strangler (after the read-only kinds, the merger/on-call/fixers,
  the coder, and blueprints).

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now routes `spec-writer` through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody` →
  `buildRegisteredAgentBody` as a read-only `mode: 'explore'` structured agent that clones the
  per-block WORK branch (`cat-factory/<blockId>` — the coder's branch, created from base when
  absent; the spec-writer runs BEFORE the coder, so it seeds that branch) instead of the
  bespoke `/spec` body. The agent now READS the baseline spec from its own checkout under
  `spec/` (the harness no longer pre-injects it) and returns ONLY the complete spec doc as JSON;
  `toRunResult` coerces that `custom` result into the `spec` channel (via `coerceSpecDoc`) the
  engine already strict-validates + ingests. The `SPEC_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is updated to point
  the agent at `spec/overview.md` + the `spec/modules/**` shards, and a new `specWriterUserPrompt`
  carries the task increment + the read-the-baseline / reuse-the-taxonomy guidance the harness
  `buildUserPrompt`/`renderTaxonomyInventory` used to inject.

  The deterministic SHARD + commit of the in-repo `spec/` artifact that used to live in the
  executor-harness `/spec` handler now runs as a BACKEND built-in post-op (`specPostOp`,
  `@cat-factory/agents`), over the checkout-free `RepoFiles` port. It is keyed by the engine's
  own built-in op map in `ExecutionService` — deliberately NOT the agent-kind registry, so the
  built-ins never leak into `customAgentKinds` / the SPA palette. It reproduces the harness
  reconcile exactly: the canonical `service.json` / `overview.md` / `modules/<m>/<g>.{json,md}`
  shards are always rewritten and a removed module/group's shards are PRUNED (the deletion
  channel); the Gherkin `features/<m>/<g>.feature` files are SEEDED-ONCE (committed only when
  absent, never clobbering a polished one); and the pre-sharding monolithic artifacts
  (`spec/spec.json` / `rules.md` / `version.json`) + old flat `features/*.feature` files are
  dropped on sight. Idempotent: the spec has no `version.json` manifest, so the post-op
  byte-compares each rendered shard to the branch and makes NO commit when everything matches
  and there is nothing to seed or prune (durable-driver replay re-commits nothing).

  Because the spec doc is handed onward to be sharded + committed, the migrated kind opts into
  a new `output.failOnUnusableFinal` flag (kernel `AgentOutputSpec`) so the generic explore
  handler FAILS the run LOUDLY when the agent's final answer is cut off at the output ceiling
  (or empty) — restoring the bespoke `/spec` handler's `unusableFinalAnswerCause` gate, which
  the generic `handleAgent` path lacked, so a truncated reply can no longer be laundered into a
  half-baked spec by the structured repair. This is a harness change, so the executor-harness
  image is bumped to `1.12.0` (the `deploy/backend` `image:publish` tag + `wrangler.toml` are
  bumped to match). The dead `/spec` handler is removed in a later sweep step.

  Cross-runtime conformance asserts the post-op shards + commits the `spec/` artifact onto the
  work branch via `RepoFiles` on both runtimes.

  Also fixes a facade-parity gap in the self-hosted runner-pool result coercion
  (`HttpRunnerPoolProvider.coerceRunnerResult`): the generic `agent`-kind structured channel
  `custom` was missing from the pass-through allow-list, so a migrated kind's doc
  (blueprints / spec-writer / merger / on-call) was silently dropped on a runner-pool backend
  while the Cloudflare/local transports — which return the harness view verbatim — kept it.
  `custom` now passes through, and a regression test covers it.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 57cf33e: Bump the bundled subscription harness CLIs to their latest stable releases:
  Claude Code `2.0.30` → `2.1.191` and Codex `0.47.0` → `0.142.0` (Pi unchanged).

  This changes the runner image contents, so the image tag is bumped to `1.11.0` in
  both `deploy/backend/package.json` (`image:publish`) and `deploy/backend/wrangler.toml`
  (`[[containers]] image`). Republish + redeploy the managed-registry image to roll it out.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d0081e1: Shard the in-repo `spec/` artifact by a module → feature taxonomy to kill merge churn.

  The spec-writer no longer commits a single monolithic `spec/spec.json` (+ `overview.md`
  / `rules.md` / `version.json`); every spec run rewrote those whole files, so two task
  branches that both touched the spec conflicted hard on merge. The spec is now SHARDED:
  a tiny `spec/service.json`, an `spec/overview.md` index, and one canonical
  `spec/modules/<module>/<group>.json` (+ a human `<group>.md`) per feature group, with
  the Gherkin `spec/features/<module>/<group>.feature` files nested to match. A group's
  file bytes depend only on that group, so concurrent branches editing different
  features never touch the same file.

  **Breaking (acceptable per pre-1.0 policy — no migration):**

  - `@cat-factory/contracts`: `SpecDoc` gains a two-level taxonomy — `modules: SpecModule[]`
    where each module holds `groups`, and each group carries BOTH its `requirements` and the
    domain `rules` scoped to it. The top-level `SpecDoc.groups`/`SpecDoc.rules`,
    the `SpecVersion`/`version.json` manifest, and the `SPEC_JSON_PATH`/`SPEC_RULES_PATH`/
    `SPEC_VERSION_PATH` path constants are removed; `SPEC_SERVICE_PATH`/`SPEC_MODULES_DIR`
    are added. `renderSpecForReview` walks the new shape. An existing repo's monolithic
    `spec.json` / `rules.md` / `version.json` (and any old flat `features/*.feature` files)
    are DELETED on the next spec run — the sharded layout is written fresh; no migration.
  - `@cat-factory/executor-harness`: sharded deterministic render + on-disk reassembly
    read-back + orphan-shard pruning (a removed/renamed module or group is deleted, not
    resurrected) + a one-time prune of the pre-sharding monolithic/flat artifacts;
    `version.json` dropped (no-op detection is now per-file via the commit).
    Content-derived (not positional) rule ids keep a group file byte-stable. The spec-writer
    prompt + reassembled-baseline now carry an EXISTING-taxonomy inventory and steer the
    agent to slot new requirements/rules into the closest existing module + feature (reusing
    exact names) rather than spawning near-duplicate domains/groups. Ships in the **1.9.0**
    runner image already pinned in `deploy/backend` (no further tag move needed).
  - `@cat-factory/agents`: the runtime-neutral `repo-ops/render.ts` mirror is reworked to
    the same sharded layout (`renderSpecVersionFile`/`nextSpecVersion`/`canonicalSpecJson`/
    `hashSpec` for the spec removed); `SPEC_AWARE_GUIDANCE` points readers at
    `spec/modules/<module>/<feature>.{md,json}`.
  - `@cat-factory/server`: `SPEC_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` describes the module → feature →
    {requirements, rules} structure, the no-catch-all rule, and the taxonomy-reuse rule.

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c20968: Add the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness kind + its backend dispatch.

  - `@cat-factory/executor-harness`: a single generic `agent` job kind (`parseAgentJob` +
    `handleAgent`) that runs an LLM over an optional checkout in one of two modes —
    `explore` (read-only; returns prose, or a parsed `custom` JSON object) or `coding`
    (clone/edit/commit/push, optionally open a PR), built on the existing
    `runAgentInWorkspace`/`runCodingAgent`/`resolveStructuredOutput` primitives. It holds no
    per-agent-kind logic; the bespoke kinds remain during migration. **Image bump** (the
    deploy tag moves to `1.9.0` so the new kind rolls out).
  - `@cat-factory/kernel`: `RunnerDispatchKind` gains `'agent'`; `RunnerJobResult` and
    `AgentRunResult` gain a generic `custom` channel for a structured agent's output. The
    `GitHubClient` port gains `branchHeadSha` — an exact single-ref head lookup that stays
    correct on repos with more branches than one `listBranches` page (the create-vs-commit
    signal `RepoFiles.headSha` relies on).
  - `@cat-factory/server`: `ContainerAgentExecutor` dispatches any registered kind that
    declares an `agent` step through the generic `agent` kind (`buildRegisteredAgentBody`)
    and maps `custom` results; built-in kinds are unchanged. New `RepoFiles` implementation
    (`makeRepoFiles`/`makeResolveRepoFiles`, a checkout-free facade over the `GitHubClient`
    Git Data API) + a `runRepoOps` helper — the substrate the pre/post-op engine wiring will
    use next.

## 1.8.2

### Patch Changes

- fef2964: Build the workspace before the container acceptance tests in `docker-publish.yml`. The
  acceptance suite imports built packages (`@cat-factory/spend`, `@cat-factory/server`)
  that resolve to their gitignored `./dist`, which `pnpm install` never produces, so the
  job failed at import time with "Failed to resolve entry for package @cat-factory/spend".
  Adding `pnpm build` fixes the publish pipeline; the harness bump republishes the runner
  image. No harness behaviour change.

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 9110dd3: Bump the executor-harness to republish the runner image and exercise the `docker-publish.yml` pipeline end to end (GHCR + Docker Hub). No harness behaviour change; the version bump touches the harness `package.json`, which is the path that gates the image publish.

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d11833: Companion agents + acceptance-test rework (the structured spec replaces the
  client-only scenario surface), plus a vocabulary split so "requirements" (the
  linked-prose context review) and "spec" (the structured in-repo document) are no
  longer the same word.

  - **Companion agents.** A companion grades a prior producer step's output, returns
    an overall quality rating (0..1), and — below the step's threshold (default 0.8) —
    loops the producer back for automatic rework BEFORE a human is asked, failing the
    run (`companion_rejected`) once the rework budget is spent. Companions declare an
    allow-list of target kinds and are placed as their own chain step in the pipeline
    builder (with a per-step `thresholds` array, parallel to `gates`). Built-ins:
    `architect-companion`, `spec-companion`, and `reviewer` reframed as the coder's
    companion. Wired into `ExecutionService` (`evaluateCompanion` + a unified rework
    revision path shared with the human "request changes" flow).
  - **Companion-gated requirements rework.** The per-block requirements review's
    rework step is now gated by a quality companion: below threshold the reworked doc
    is NOT accepted (the review stays `ready`), and the companion's challenge is
    surfaced in the review window and fed into the next rework. Persisted on
    `requirement_reviews.companion` (D1 migration 0036 + Drizzle).
  - **Acceptance tests via the spec.** The client-only scenarios store/UI is removed;
    the structured Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios live in the service spec
    (authored by the `spec-writer`, reviewed on its gated step) and are derived into
    Gherkin. The redundant `acceptance` polish agent is dropped; `playwright` still
    writes the runnable tests. `spec-writer`'s prompt now treats complete
    acceptance-scenario coverage as a first-class deliverable.
  - **`architect` is now a container agent** that explores the repo (read-only, like
    `analysis`) before proposing. Both read-only kinds share one reusable execution
    path: a new harness `/explore` endpoint (dispatch kind `explore`) clones the branch,
    runs the agent read-only and returns its prose report/proposal — making no commit,
    opening no PR, and (unlike `/run`) NOT treating an edit-free run as a failure. A
    shared read-only guardrail is appended to their system prompts.
  - **Companion rework correctness.** When a companion loops a producer back, EVERY step
    between the producer and the companion is now reset and re-run (clearing stale
    container job handles), so an intermediate container step re-dispatches fresh work
    instead of re-attaching to its evicted job. The automatic rework budget now counts
    only automatic attempts (`companion.attempts`); a human "request changes" on a
    companion's gate re-runs the producer without consuming it.
  - **Rename: requirements → spec** for the structured family. In-repo `requirements/`
    → `spec/` (`spec.json`, `spec/features/*.feature`; legacy `requirements/`
    relocated on first run); `RequirementsDoc` → `SpecDoc`; `requirements-writer` →
    `spec-writer`; the pipeline analyst `requirements` → `requirements-review`;
    `pl_requirements` → `pl_spec`. The context-review family (`RequirementReview*`,
    `requirement_reviews`) keeps the `requirements` name.

  The harness image changed (the `/requirements` endpoint + `requirements/` paths
  became `/spec` + `spec/`), so `@cat-factory/executor-harness` and the
  `deploy/backend` image tag are bumped to 1.0.6 and must be re-published + rolled out.

- e8005ba: Datadog post-release-health gate + Agent-On-Call.

  After a release ships, a new **`post-release-health`** polling gate watches the team's
  Datadog **monitors/SLOs** over a monitoring window. It reuses the existing gate machinery
  (`ci`/`conflicts`): a clean window advances with nothing spun up; a regression escalates —
  Datadog credentials stay on the backend and never enter containers.

  The gate is **opt-in**: it is NOT in any default pipeline. A user adds it deliberately in
  the pipeline builder, and it only appears in the palette — and is only accepted by the
  backend — once the workspace has an **observability integration connected** (today a
  Datadog connection). `PipelineService` rejects a `create`/`update` that adds an enabled
  `post-release-health` step otherwise.

  - **No blind revert.** On a regression the gate dispatches an **`on-call`** container agent
    that clones the base branch (the merged release; the work branch is deleted on merge),
    locates the merged commit and correlates its diff with the regression evidence (alerting
    monitors/SLOs + recent error logs), returning a JSON assessment (culprit confidence +
    `revert`/`hold`/`monitor` recommendation). It makes no commits and reverts nothing — the
    engine raises a **`release_regression`** notification for a human to decide. The gate only
    engages once the PR actually merged, attributes only post-release alerts (not pre-existing
    ones) to the release, and honours the full configured watch window even when it outlasts a
    single poll budget.
  - **Datadog connection + monitor/SLO mapping** are per-workspace (keys sealed at rest under
    a `cat-factory:datadog` cipher, write-only), managed in a new settings panel and the
    `GET|PUT|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/datadog/connection` + `/release-health-configs/:blockId`
    API. The gate maps a run's repo to its service-frame config (monitor + SLO ids + env tag).
  - **Merge-preset knobs**: `releaseWatchWindowMinutes` (default 30) and `releaseMaxAttempts`
    (default 1) bound the watch window + on-call dispatches.
  - **Incident enrichment (optional, additive):** PagerDuty / incident.io are NOT used to
    re-alert (they already page off the same monitors/SLOs) — instead the on-call
    investigation is posted onto an incident they already opened (annotate, never duplicate),
    behind a new `IncidentEnrichmentProvider` port. Slack + the in-app inbox carry the
    human-facing `release_regression` notification.
  - Runtime-symmetric: D1 (`datadog_connections`, `release_health_configs` + the two preset
    columns) ⇄ Drizzle/Postgres, wired in both the Cloudflare Worker and Node/local facades.
  - New harness route `POST /on-call`; the executor-harness image is bumped to `1.7.1`.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable):** `merge_threshold_presets` gains two columns — stale rows
  are re-seeded with the defaults.

- b40da13: Simplify task granularity and run configuration; open the pipeline-step detail
  overlay from the zoomed-in board.

  - **Open the agent step-detail overlay from the board.** Clicking a pipeline agent
    in a zoomed-in task card now opens the full `AgentStepDetail` overlay (execution
    metadata + the agent's prose output), exactly like clicking it from the inspector
    or the focus-view pipeline — instead of expanding raw text inside the card.
  - **Removed the per-task auto-merge "confidence threshold".** The confidence-score
    auto-merge gate (`Block.confidenceThreshold`, the inspector + task-card UI, the
    `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` constant) is gone; the `merger` step's merge-policy
    preset (complexity/risk/impact ceilings) is the sole auto-merge gate. (The raw
    `confidence` score is still recorded for transparency.)
  - **Removed "feature" tracking from the board and the service map.** `Block.features`
    (the inspector's "Features implemented" tags and the board/module feature badges)
    is removed, and the in-repo blueprint / board-scan decomposition is now
    service → modules only — the Blueprinter, harness rendering, and reconciliation no
    longer produce a "feature" sub-level or derive tasks from it. Acceptance scenarios
    are now freeform per task (decoupled from features) pending a deeper
    requirements-driven model.
  - **Task creation picks a pipeline + merge policy; model selection removed.** The
    "Add a task" modal now offers a default pipeline (`Block.pipelineId`, which the
    task's Run/Start controls use) and a merge policy preset. The per-task model
    picker is gone — a model is resolved per step, not per task.

  Migration `0025_task_run_config.sql` drops the `confidence_threshold` and `features`
  columns and adds `pipeline_id`. Bumps `@cat-factory/executor-harness` (the blueprint
  rendering inside its image changed).

- b305349: Raise the harness output ceiling and guard against malformed final answers.

  - `PI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` 16k → 32k (and the structured-repair call now references it
    rather than hard-coding 16k). It is a per-completion ceiling, not a target — unused
    tokens are unbilled and Workers AI clamps to the model's real max — so this is safe
    headroom for larger specs/diffs. The shared LLM proxy (`@cat-factory/server`,
    served by both runtimes) only FLOORS workers-ai output, it does not cap, so the
    higher request flows through unchanged on Cloudflare and Node alike.
  - New `runDiagnostics` over Pi's transcript reports whether any completion hit the
    output ceiling (`truncated`/`finalTruncated`) and whether the agent's final turn
    produced no text at all (`finalAnswerEmpty` — an empty `content: []` despite spent
    output tokens, observed from `kimi-k2.7-code`). It is computed universally but acted
    on per agent: the document producers that hand a final answer ONWARD to be reviewed
    (spec-writer, blueprinter) now fail loudly with a clear cause instead of letting the
    structured-output repair manufacture a half-baked artifact from garbage. Side-effect
    agents (coder/ci-fixer/conflict-resolver pushing a PR or commit) are unaffected — an
    empty final turn is normal for them.

  Bumps the runner image tag to 1.5.0 (deploy/backend `image:publish` + wrangler.toml).

- 918764f: Extend the Langfuse observability with **tool spans**: each container agent's tool
  calls now surface as spans under its run's trace, alongside that run's LLM generations
  (both are children of the one run trace, keyed by the execution id).

  The harness buffers a compact, metadata-only `ToolSpan` (`{tool, startedAt, endedAt,
ok}` — never tool args/results) per completed Pi tool call and returns the batch on its
  existing `GET /jobs/{id}` poll with **drain-on-read** semantics (each poll returns the
  spans since the last poll and clears the buffer). No new network from the container, no
  hot-path work — only in-memory accumulation bounded to one poll interval, so OOM risk is
  nil. `ContainerAgentExecutor.pollJob` forwards each drained batch to the trace sink as
  spans under the run trace (`jobId === executionId`, the same trace id the LLM
  generations use). Best-effort and fully isolated — a sink failure never affects the job
  lifecycle.

  Bumps the `@cat-factory/executor-harness` image tag (1.2.0 → 1.3.0); a deploy is needed
  to roll out the harness change. The self-hosted runner-pool path (arbitrary,
  manifest-driven APIs) gracefully yields no tool spans; the Cloudflare-container and
  local-Docker paths carry them through automatically.

- 5ec0d25: Real merge lifecycle: CI gate + CI-fixer, merger agent, and notifications.

  A task now becomes `done` only when its pull request is **actually merged** on
  GitHub — fixing the bug where a task showed "merged" (and a green board) from a
  confidence score alone, while CI was red and the PR still open.

  - **CI gate (`ci` step)** — auto-inserted before the merger in the standard
    pipelines. It polls the PR head's GitHub check runs and, on failure, dispatches a
    new **`ci-fixer`** container agent that pushes a fix to the PR branch, looping up
    to a configurable budget (default 10) until CI is green; polling stops the moment
    CI goes green. If the budget is spent it raises a `ci_failed` notification.
  - **Merger agent (`merger` step)** — runs last. A container agent scores the PR's
    complexity / risk / impact, and the engine compares those against the task's
    **merge threshold preset** to either auto-merge (a real GitHub merge) or raise a
    `merge_review` notification for a human. Presets are a per-workspace library
    (selectable per task); the CI-fixer attempt budget lives on the preset.
  - **`merger` is appended to the standard pipelines.** A pipeline with no merger now
    raises a `pipeline_complete` notification on completion (confirm + merge) instead
    of silently marking the task done.
  - **Notifications** — a new first-class, human-actionable board surface (inbox +
    events), modelled behind a `NotificationChannel` port so email/Slack delivery can
    be added later without touching the call sites. In-app delivery only for now.

  Adds migration `0024_merge_lifecycle.sql` (notifications + merge-preset tables, the
  `blocks.merge_preset_id` column). The executor-harness image gains `/ci-fix` and
  `/merge` endpoints (version bumped so the GHCR image is re-tagged).

- a691853: Monorepo support: select a subset of a repo's services and pin each to a subdirectory.

  A linked GitHub repository can now be flagged a **monorepo** (`github_repos.is_monorepo`,
  D1 migration `0044` ⇄ Drizzle), which lets it back **more than one** board service —
  each pinned to its own subdirectory (`services.directory`). The "Add service from repo"
  modal gains a monorepo toggle and a **directory browser** (`GET
/workspaces/:ws/github/repos/:id/tree`, served from GitHub's contents API via
  `GitHubSyncService.listRepoDirectory`) so you can explore the repo and pick the
  directory of the service you want — and add several (a subset of the repo's services).
  `PATCH /workspaces/:ws/github/repos/:id` sets the monorepo flag.

  The chosen subdirectory is **fed to the agents that build the service** when the repo is
  a monorepo: `buildResolveRepoTarget` resolves a frame's service (so multiple frames can
  target one repo) and returns its `serviceDirectory`, which flows through the container
  job body into the harness. The implementation agents — **coder, mocker and ci-fixer**
  (everything routed through `runCodingAgent`) — run with their working directory set to
  that subtree and are told, in their AGENTS.md context, that they're in a monorepo and to
  scope their work (and build/test commands) to it. The cross-cutting agents keep operating
  at the repo root by design: the **conflict-resolver** and **merger** act on the whole
  merge / diff, and the **blueprint** and **requirements** agents write repo-root artifacts.
  Non-monorepo repos keep the historical whole-repo behaviour.

  Known limitation: the in-repo blueprint (`blueprints/`) and requirements (`requirements/`)
  artifacts are still written at the repo root, so two services backed by the same monorepo
  share — and would overwrite — those files. Per-service artifact paths are a follow-up.

- f49fa30: Give container agents (coder, ci-fixer, mocker, blueprints, analysis, …) `web_search` /
  `web_fetch` via the `@juicesharp/rpiv-web-tools` Pi extension installed in the
  executor-harness image — without putting a search-provider key in the sandbox.

  The backend hosts a SearXNG-compatible **web-search proxy** at `${proxyBaseUrl}/web-search`
  (`webSearchProxyController`, mounted under the LLM proxy's public `/v1`). A container
  authenticates with the SAME short-lived, model-locked session token it uses for the LLM
  proxy; the facade verifies it and runs the search server-side through the `webSearch`
  runtime gateway, under the deployment's own provider key. Two upstreams ship: Brave
  (`WEB_SEARCH_BRAVE_API_KEY`, the recommended one-key path, what Claude Code uses) and a
  reverse proxy to a self-hosted SearXNG (`WEB_SEARCH_SEARXNG_URL` [+ `_API_KEY`]). Both
  runtime facades wire it from env, so it works on Cloudflare (where per-run container env
  vars can't be injected) and on the Node self-hosted runner pool alike — no provider
  secret ever enters the container, matching the LLM-proxy posture.

  When the proxy is configured, `ContainerAgentExecutor` sets `webSearch: true` on the
  coding/ci-fixer job body; the harness then points rpiv-web-tools' SearXNG provider at the
  proxy (the token as its bearer) and surfaces a kind-aware usage nudge (via
  `@cat-factory/agents`' `webResearchGuidanceFor`). Self-hosted runner pools may still
  configure a provider key directly in the container env (auto-detected as before); an
  explicit `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER` pin now requires that provider's credential to be present
  so the agent is never told about a tool that would error. The two web tools count as
  read-only exploration for the no-edit guard, but a dedicated cap
  (`JOB_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_WEB_CALLS`, default 25) stops a search rabbit-hole.

  Changes the image, so the harness version (its GHCR image tag) bumps.

- 75a0441: Fix the review, testing and merge gates so findings are acted on and a bad merge
  can't slip through.

  - Pipeline order: the `reviewer` companion now runs IMMEDIATELY after `coder`
    (before `blueprints`/`mocker`/`tester`), in `pl_full`, `pl_fullstack`,
    `pl_dep_update` and `pl_tech_debt`, so review + rework happen on freshly written
    code before the map/test tail. The positional `gates` arrays are unchanged (the
    gated slots all sit before `coder`).
  - First review batch always loops back: the FIRST companion pass (reviewer /
    spec-companion / architect-companion) that raises any comments now loops the
    producer back regardless of rating; the configured threshold only governs the
    SECOND pass onward. The same rule applies to the `tester` gate: the first testing
    round hands ANY finding (even a low/medium concern) to the fixer, and low/medium
    concerns become advisory only from the second round.
  - Review results no longer silently pass: a companion whose own JSON verdict can't
    be parsed (e.g. a truncated reply) used to default to a perfect 100% pass and drop
    the real review. The engine now retries once and, if the verdict still won't parse,
    fails the run for human attention. Companions also get a larger output-token budget
    so the verdict JSON doesn't truncate in the first place.
  - Merger can't auto-merge a PR it didn't examine: the merger harness now does a full
    clone (so `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` actually works — the shallow single-branch
    clone was the root cause of "branch not found" and bogus 0/0/0 scores) and, when it
    still can't examine a real diff, returns a conservative assessment that routes to
    human review. The engine additionally only auto-merges a credible, explained
    (non-empty rationale) within-threshold assessment.

  Bumps the executor-harness image tag (merger clone change) to 1.4.0.

- a54ada2: Spec-writer now applies ONE task's requirements as an increment, not a service-wide aggregate.

  The spec-writer used to receive `serviceTasks` — every task under the block's service
  frame, merged or not — and fold them all into one document. So a run for a single task
  ("add CRUD for office tables") produced a spec covering five unrelated sibling resources,
  and the spec-reviewer correctly read it as scope contamination. That violates the
  branched-work model: a task's baseline is what's already merged, plus its own increment;
  an unmerged sibling task does not exist for it.

  The spec-writer now reads the spec already committed on its work branch (the baseline)
  and applies ONLY the current task's clarified/reworked requirements as an increment —
  adding what the task introduces and adjusting existing requirements only where the task
  changes their behaviour. It translates the given requirements and does not invent or fill
  gaps (that is the requirements step's job). The in-repo `spec.json` stays the complete
  service spec; only the writer's editing scope narrows.

  - Engine: removed `gatherServiceTasks` and the `serviceTasks` field from
    `AgentRunContext`. The dispatch feeds the single task (the block, whose description is
    already the reworked requirements).
  - Reviewer: the `spec-companion` now judges fidelity to the requirements it was given and
    no longer penalises the writer for requirements it was never handed.
  - Harness (`SpecJob.tasks` → `SpecJob.task`): the prompt is reframed as "baseline plus
    this task's increment". Image retagged 1.6.0 → 1.7.0 (deploy/backend `image:publish` +
    wrangler.toml) so the new digest rolls out.

  Breaking: the `/spec` harness job shape changes (`tasks: []` → `task: {}`) and
  `AgentRunContext.serviceTasks` is gone. No migration — stale in-flight jobs simply break.

- 5ca8086: Add alternate subscription-backed coding harnesses (Claude Code / Codex) alongside
  the Pi proxy harness.

  - New per-workspace **subscription token pool** (`provider_subscription_tokens`,
    D1 + Postgres, encrypted at rest) with usage-aware rotation, behind a kernel
    port + `ProviderSubscriptionService`, wired into all three runtimes.
  - A guided **LLM Vendors** navbar UI to connect Claude / Codex / GLM (Z.ai) /
    Kimi (Moonshot) / DeepSeek subscription credentials (token pool, write-only).
    GLM / Kimi / DeepSeek all run via Claude Code against the vendor's
    Anthropic-compatible endpoint; the unfiltered credential list covers every vendor.
  - The executor-harness image now bundles the Claude Code and Codex CLIs; the
    harness selects `pi` / `claude-code` / `codex` per job from the model, and the
    subscription harnesses authenticate direct-to-vendor (no proxy) and report token
    usage from the CLI event stream for rotation + telemetry.
  - The model catalog becomes a canonical-model → provider map with precedence
    **subscription > direct > cloudflare** ("subscriptions always win"): latest
    Opus/Sonnet + GPT-5.5/5.4 (subscription-only), GLM-5.2/Kimi gain a Claude-Code
    subscription flavour, and `ModelOption` now carries per-flavour cost, context
    window, and a `quotaBased` flag (subscription usage is flat-rate quota, never
    billed against the spend budget).
  - A block's model is shared by all its pipeline steps, so a pin to a subscription-only
    model (Claude Code / Codex — container-only, no provider key) is degraded to the
    step's env-routing default for every INLINE LLM path through one shared seam
    (`inlineModelRef` / `resolveInlineModelRef`): both the inline agent executor and the
    requirements reviewer/rework, so the inline steps run instead of hard-failing and the
    two paths can't drift. The claude-code subscription harness repairs malformed
    structured output through the vendor's own Anthropic-compatible endpoint (the Pi
    harness still uses the proxy; Codex keeps the graceful no-repair path).
  - Hardening: the per-vendor token pool is capped to bound growth; the leased
    subscription credential is scrubbed from subscription-repair error details (not just
    GitHub-shaped secrets); and Codex token usage is read from its cumulative
    `total_token_usage` so multi-turn runs attribute usage correctly for rotation.

- cc8d96a: Flesh out the Tester agent, add an agent configuration-contribution mechanism, and
  make Mocker always precede Tester.

  - **Pipelines:** every built-in pipeline that runs a `tester` now runs `mocker`
    immediately before it, so the Tester has its external-dependency mocks up.
  - **Config contribution:** agents (built-in or custom, via the agent registry's new
    `configContributions`) declare task-level config parameters. The union over a
    task's pipeline appears on task creation + the inspector and freezes once the
    contributing agent's step starts. Values persist as a sparse `agentConfig` map on
    the block (keys/values length-capped); the catalog rides the workspace snapshot. The
    Tester contributes its `environment` (local vs ephemeral) and Playwright its e2e
    target (CI vs ephemeral). The old fixed `testTarget` block field is dropped — its
    column is dropped on both runtimes too (no backwards-compat shim).
  - **Tester → Fixer loop:** `tester` is now a container agent that runs the project's
    tests — standing infra up locally via the service's docker-compose (rootless
    Docker-in-Docker in the harness) or against an ephemeral environment — and returns
    a structured report (what was tested, outcomes, concerns, greenlight). On a
    withheld greenlight the engine loops a new dedicated `fixer` agent with the report
    and re-tests, up to the task's merge-preset attempt budget. Only **blocking
    (high/critical)** concerns withhold the greenlight — low/medium are advisory, so a
    trivial nit can't burn the whole fixer budget — and the engine re-applies that rule
    defensively over the report. When the budget is spent (or there's no PR branch to
    fix, or the report is unparseable) the run fails for real (the tester step is left
    un-`done`) and raises a human-actionable `test_failed` notification (retry action),
    mirroring the CI gate. New harness `/test` + `/fix-tests` endpoints; reports + fixer
    summaries render in the inspector and step detail.
  - **Service + provisioning config:** a service frame carries the Tester's
    docker-compose path / "no infra dependencies" toggle (a Tester pipeline can't start
    until one is set), plus a cloud provider and abstract instance size that resolve to
    the concrete instance-type id forwarded to the runner. Per-service sizing applies to
    the self-hosted-pool and local-Docker backends; the Cloudflare Container backend has
    a fixed per-class instance type (`wrangler.toml`) with no per-dispatch override, so
    it ignores the hints (pick `cloudflare` when you don't need per-service sizing).
  - **Account default cloud provider (fully wired):** accounts carry a
    `defaultCloudProvider` new services inherit — persisted on both runtimes, settable
    via `PATCH /accounts/:id` (owner-only) and the account menu, returned on the account
    wire, and pre-filled as the service editor's provider default.
  - **Local mode is 100% Docker/Podman:** a new first-class `docker` cloud provider
    represents the local daemon. The local runner backend sizes each per-job container
    from the abstract instance size (`--memory`/`--cpus`) and runs the Tester job
    `--privileged` so it stands its docker-compose infra up with Docker-in-Docker on the
    host daemon — never Cloudflare. A Tester-only pipeline with no PR branch now fails
    cleanly (no fixer to push to) instead of throwing.
  - Mirrored across both runtimes (D1 migration ⇄ Drizzle schema + migration).

### Patch Changes

- e28a63d: Bump the pinned Pi coding agent (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) from 0.79.4 to
  0.79.8 in the executor-harness image. Changes the image, so the harness version (its
  GHCR/registry image tag) bumps with it.
- 3e7ab89: Make the conflict-resolver actually see the conflict, and stop it churning to 10 attempts.

  Telemetry on a failed run showed the `conflict-resolver` was handed `userPromptFor(context)`
  — the full task brief plus every prior agent's output (~53 KB) — with no mention of which
  files conflicted or that there were conflicts at all. The model drifted onto the original
  feature task (it returned a "test report is ready" answer) and never touched the markers,
  so the gate re-dispatched 10 times with the PR head SHA never moving, then failed the run.

  - Harness: when the base merge surfaces conflicts, build a conflict-focused prompt that
    leads with the exact conflicted files and their `git diff` hunks (new `conflictDiff`
    helper), keeping the task only as a trailing reference. Clean merges and no-op
    "already up to date" cases are now logged distinctly so the "GitHub says conflicting but
    the local merge is clean" loop is diagnosable. Bumps the harness image (1.7.1 -> 1.7.2).
  - Server: the conflict-resolver job body no longer renders `userPromptFor(context)`; it
    sends only a compact task reference (title + description). The harness supplies the
    actual conflict material.
  - Orchestration: the conflicts gate now caps escalations at 3 (was CI's default of 10) via
    its own `attemptBudget` — a conflict retry re-merges the same base with no new signal, so
    it fails fast to a manual-resolution notification instead of burning containers.

- 3a12f15: Make container coding runs durable and restart-resilient, and stop the harness
  committing files the agent didn't choose.

  - **Agent owns commits, harness owns push.** The harness no longer blanket-stages
    (`git add -A`) the working tree — which would sweep in scratch scripts and build
    artifacts the agent created while exploring. The agent commits its own work (only it
    knows what belongs); the harness pushes those commits and opens the PR. A safety net
    (`commitTrackedEdits` → `git add -u`) still captures forgotten edits to ALREADY
    tracked files, but never untracked junk. A run is a no-op only when the branch never
    advanced past its pre-run tip.
  - **Checkpoint + resume.** The harness pushes the branch periodically during a run
    (`JOB_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_MS`, default 60s), so an evicted container's commits
    survive on the branch. The work branch is now deterministic per task
    (`cat-factory/<blockId>`), so a retry (fresh execution id) or a sweeper re-drive
    targets the SAME branch; the harness detects it already exists and RESUMES on it
    (cloning it and continuing on its commits) instead of starting over. `openPullRequest`
    is now idempotent (a resumed branch's existing PR is reused, not re-failed).
    A checkpoint only pushes once the branch has actually advanced past its pre-run tip,
    so a run that never commits leaves no empty work branch behind (which would otherwise
    make a later retry treat the base commit as resumable work and fail to open a PR).
  - **Branch torn down on merge.** Because the work branch is deterministic per task, the
    platform now deletes it when its PR merges (new `GitHubClient.deleteBranch` port +
    `GitHubPullRequestMerger`), so a later re-run of the same block starts fresh from base
    instead of resuming on already-merged commits (which a squash/rebase merge would
    otherwise re-introduce). Best-effort: a failed delete never fails the completed merge.
  - **Resumed branch refreshed against base.** A resumed branch was cut from an older base,
    so the harness now merges the latest base in when the two merge cleanly
    (`refreshFromBaseIfClean`), keeping the PR current; on a conflict it aborts and
    continues on the stale base (the merge gate handles a conflicting PR downstream).

- 41d16f0: Write the agent's composed system prompt to Pi's **global** context file
  (`~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`, alongside the existing `models.json`) instead of into
  the repo checkout (`<repo>/AGENTS.md`). The instructions already travel headlessly
  in the job body — only the harness→Pi hop went through a file in the working tree.
  Moving it out-of-tree means it can never be committed into a PR (across run,
  ci-fix, bootstrap, and blueprint), and a repo's own committed `AGENTS.md` is now
  read and concatenated by Pi rather than clobbered/overwritten. Removes the
  scattered `AGENTS.md` special-casing in `hasAgentChanges`, the bootstrap no-op
  check, and the benchmark diff exclusion. Changes the image, so the harness version
  (its GHCR/registry image tag) bumps with it.
- 3a12f15: Add a live no-progress guard to the container coding agent so a run that has plainly
  stopped making progress is killed early with a useful diagnostic, instead of burning
  the whole budget and failing with a generic "no file changes".

  `runPi` now feeds every streamed Pi event to a `ProgressGuard` that aborts when the
  agent makes many tool calls without ever editing a file (the signature of the
  credential rabbit-hole: exploring/probing the environment without implementing) or
  makes too many consecutive failing tool calls. Bounds are env-configurable
  (`JOB_MAX_TOOLCALLS_WITHOUT_EDIT`, `JOB_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TOOL_ERRORS`); the no-edit
  bound is skipped for assess-only runs (`expectsEdits: false`) so a run that correctly
  makes zero edits is never falsely aborted — this covers both the merger AND the
  Blueprinter, which explores the repo and returns the service tree as JSON (the harness
  renders the files), so it never calls an edit tool itself. The edit-tool detection
  also recognises alternate names case-insensitively (`apply_patch`/`str_replace`/
  `multiedit`/… in addition to `edit`/`write`) so a model that mutates files under a
  different tool name is not mistaken for one making no edits. The no-edit bound counts
  only "action" calls (chiefly `bash`, the rabbit-hole's vector): read-only exploration
  (`read`/`grep`/`glob`/…) and planning (`todo`) are excluded, so a large task that
  legitimately reads or searches many files before its first edit is not killed for it
  (the default ceiling is correspondingly generous).

- 157cd02: Standardize the executor-harness job API on a single `POST /jobs` endpoint with the
  agent kind carried in the request body, instead of one route per kind (`/run`,
  `/bootstrap`, `/merge`, …).

  Breaking wire change between the runtime transports and the harness image (acceptable
  pre-1.0: the two ship together, no external consumers). The old per-kind-route image
  is incompatible with the new transports, so the runner image MUST be republished and
  deployed.

  - Harness: `server.ts` is now table-driven — one `KINDS` registry keyed by kind drives
    a single `POST /jobs` dispatcher (reads the body's `kind` to pick the validator +
    registry) and a single `GET /jobs/{id}` poll. Adding an agent kind is one table
    entry, not a new endpoint + registry global + poll-chain branch. Bumps the runner
    image tag (1.7.2 -> 1.7.3) in `deploy/backend` (`image:publish` + wrangler.toml).
  - Harness: the explore job's temp-dir/log label field is renamed `kind` -> `label` so
    it no longer collides with the reserved dispatch discriminator `kind`.
  - Server: `ContainerAgentExecutor` stamps the kind into the dispatch body (the explore
    body now sends `label` for its agent-kind label).
  - Worker + local-server transports POST `{ ...spec, kind }` to `/jobs`;
    `LocalDockerRunnerTransport` drops its `KIND_ROUTE` map. The self-hosted pool already
    forwards `kind` in the spec, so it needs no code change — only the manifest docs
    (kernel/contracts/integrations) are updated to note the harness routes by the body's
    `kind`.

- 7c37653: Fail a container agent run when Pi ends in a terminal error, even on exit 0.

  Pi can exit 0 while the agent run itself ended in a hard error (every model call
  failed and its auto-retries were exhausted). The harness judged success purely on
  exit code plus whether the work branch carried commits, so a run that RESUMED a
  branch with prior checkpoint commits would open a PR off work this pass never
  produced, and a totally-failed implementation surfaced as a green pipeline.

  `runPi` now inspects Pi's terminal transcript (`terminalRunError`: the trailing
  `auto_retry_end success:false`, or the last `agent_end` with `stopReason: error`)
  and rejects with that message on exit 0, so the job is reported failed across every
  container agent kind (coder/ci-fixer/bootstrap/blueprint/merger). A mid-run error
  the agent recovered from leaves a clean terminal event and is unaffected.

  Bumps the executor image tag (1.0.3 -> 1.0.4).

- 9be11e1: Fix false "no file changes" failures in the container coding agents, and converge
  the implementation (`/run`) and CI-fixer (`/ci-fix`) paths onto one shared flow.

  The build/ci-fix roles commit their work themselves, so by the end of a successful
  run the working tree is often clean — and the harness's trailing `commitAll` then
  found nothing and reported "no changes" (a hard failure for `/run`, a lost fix for
  `/ci-fix`) even though the branch carried real changes. The harness now judges the
  _whole run_ against the branch's pre-run tip (`branchHasChanges`): it counts the
  agent's own commits as well as any still-uncommitted edits, ignores the
  harness-written `AGENTS.md`, and only treats nothing-at-all as a no-op.

  The two paths were near-duplicates (clone → write context → run Pi → push), so they
  now share `runCodingAgent` (and `noChangesReason`) and diverge only in what is truly
  different: implementation branches off the base onto a fresh PR branch and opens a
  pull request; the CI-fixer works directly on the PR branch and treats a no-op as
  non-fatal. The fix therefore applies to both without being written twice. Bumps
  `@cat-factory/executor-harness` (its image logic changed).

- 6406c8c: Repo housekeeping: separate published libraries from private packages by moving
  the harnesses out of `backend/packages/` into a new `backend/internal/`
  directory — `@cat-factory/executor-harness` and `@cat-factory/benchmark-harness`.
  Updates the pnpm workspace globs, the CI path-filters + Docker build context, the
  acceptance-test worker-src alias, and the package tables in the
  README/CONTRIBUTING/CLAUDE docs. No source, public API, or image contents change
  (the patch bump just keeps the GHCR image tag in lockstep with the relocated
  package).
- 9be11e1: Add an automated merge-conflict resolver, and converge the container coding agents
  onto a shared base.

  **Conflict resolver.** Previously a PR that conflicted with its base degraded to a
  manual `merge_review` handoff. A new pre-merge `conflicts` gate now sits before the
  `ci`/`merger` steps in the standard pipelines (mirroring the CI gate): it reads the
  PR's mergeability (`PullRequestMergeabilityProvider` → GitHub `mergeable_state`) and,
  on a real conflict, dispatches a `conflict-resolver` container agent that clones the
  PR branch, merges the base in, has the agent resolve the conflicts, and pushes back
  onto the same branch — looping (bounded by the merge preset's attempt budget) until
  the PR is mergeable, or failing the run for a human if it can't. Pass-through when no
  mergeability provider is wired (e.g. tests / no GitHub), so existing behaviour is
  unchanged. The resolver never pushes a half-resolved tree (it guards on remaining
  unmerged paths).

  **Shared base.** The container agents were near-duplicates of one clone → write
  context → run Pi → push flow. They now share `runCodingAgent` (implement + ci-fix +
  conflict-resolve) on top of a thinner `withWorkspace` / `runAgentInWorkspace` base
  (also used by bootstrap / blueprint / merger), plus shared no-op-reason helpers — so
  fixes like the "judge the whole run, counting the agent's own commits" change apply
  everywhere instead of being re-derived per agent.

  Bumps `@cat-factory/executor-harness` (new `/resolve-conflicts` endpoint + shared-base
  refactor change its image).

- a112105: Optimize the runner Docker image: install Pi extensions as the unprivileged
  `harness` user (and `COPY --chown` the compiled wrapper) to drop the recursive
  `chown -R` layer that duplicated the extension tree, collapse the two `pi install`
  steps and the `git config` into single layers, and install the TS toolchain before
  copying `src` so a source edit no longer reinvalidates the dependency layer. Behavior
  is unchanged; the image is smaller and rebuilds faster.
- 0095e2c: Add an optional `onEvent` callback to `runPi` — the raw observability seam over a Pi
  run. It is invoked with every parsed Pi `--mode json` event in stream order (the full
  prompt/response/tool-call transcript), so offline tooling (the new smoketest harness)
  can capture and analyse what a model actually did without re-implementing the Pi
  driver. The container payload doesn't pass it, so production behaviour is unchanged;
  a throwing handler is swallowed so a faulty observer can't break a run. Touches the
  harness `src/**`, so the image tag bumps with it.
- 861d363: Re-tag the runner image 1.5.0 → 1.6.0 to force a rollout of the 32k output headroom.

  The `PI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` 16k → 32k bump (see harness-output-headroom-and-guards)
  landed in source under the existing 1.5.0 tag, so the deployed container kept running
  the stale 16k digest — `wrangler deploy` diffs the image by tag string and reports
  "no changes" when the tag is reused. Production telemetry confirmed it: every
  spec-writer LLM call recorded `request_max_tokens: 16384`, and one completion hit that
  ceiling exactly. A fresh, immutable tag is what forces the new digest to roll out.

  Bumps the runner image tag to 1.6.0 (deploy/backend `image:publish` + wrangler.toml).

- 954c850: Finish the `implementer` → `executor` rename so the package, directory, and
  Durable Object class match the already-published `cat-factory-executor` image.

  - `@cat-factory/implementer-harness` → `@cat-factory/executor-harness`
    (`backend/internal/implementer-harness` → `backend/internal/executor-harness`).
  - The per-run container Durable Object `ImplementationContainer` →
    `ExecutionContainer`, bound as `EXEC_CONTAINER` (was `IMPL_CONTAINER`). A
    `renamed_classes` migration (`tag = "v3"`) carries the class rename.

  **Deployment action required:** in your `wrangler.toml`, rename the
  `[[durable_objects.bindings]]` `name`/`class_name` to `EXEC_CONTAINER` /
  `ExecutionContainer`, update the `[[containers]]` `class_name`, and add the
  `v3` `renamed_classes` migration (see `deploy/backend/wrangler.toml`).

- 23b9fb6: Add a reusable structured-output abstraction with a repair retry + diagnostics for the
  JSON-returning container agents (requirements, blueprint, merger), so a single
  malformed reply no longer fails the whole run.

  A caller describes its output once as a `StructuredOutputSpec<T>` (label, shape hint,
  parser) and calls `resolveStructuredOutput`. It parses the agent's primary reply and,
  on failure, makes ONE structured "repair" call — a single-shot, no-tools,
  NON-streaming completion through the same proxy with `response_format: json_object`,
  asking the model to return only the corrected JSON — then reparses. It is
  provider-agnostic (external OpenAI-compatible upstreams honour `response_format`; the
  in-process Workers AI path ignores it but answers buffered and the focused prompt keeps
  it to JSON) and capability-gated by construction (an upstream that can't enforce
  `response_format` falls back to the prompt).

  Observability: every parse failure and repair outcome is logged (warn on first
  failure, info on recovery, error when the retry doesn't help), the repair call lands in
  `llm_call_metrics` as a NON-streaming row for the agent kind (so repair attempts are
  queryable), and a compact diagnostics suffix — including a token-doubling detector
  (`looksTokenDoubled`) that flags the streaming-corruption signature — is folded into
  the persisted failure reason. Changes the image, so the harness version (its registry
  image tag) bumps.

- 43f2443: Add a unified, persisted requirements structure stored in each service's GitHub
  repo. A new `requirements-writer` container agent runs before the coder in
  `pl_full` (and standalone via the new `pl_requirements` pipeline): it aggregates
  the clarified requirements of every task under the service frame into one
  PRESCRIPTIVE document, committed to the implementation branch
  (`cat-factory/<blockId>`, created from base when absent) so the spec is present
  before any code is written.

  The harness deterministically renders the document into `requirements/`: the
  canonical `requirements.json` (a `RequirementsDoc`), `overview.md`, `rules.md`
  (cross-cutting domain rules / invariants), a `version.json` staleness manifest,
  and Gherkin `features/*.feature` files (one `Scenario` per acceptance criterion).
  Gherkin is generated two-pass — mechanical render in the harness, then the
  `acceptance` agent polishes the `.feature` files and `playwright` turns each
  scenario into a runnable test. Every container agent reads the requirements via a
  new `REQUIREMENTS_GUIDANCE` block in its global `AGENTS.md`. The in-repo files are
  the source of truth; the engine strictly validates the returned doc
  (`parseRequirementsDoc`) at ingest. Mirrors the blueprint pattern; covered by the
  cross-runtime conformance suite.
