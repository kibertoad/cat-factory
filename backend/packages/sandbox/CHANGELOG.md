## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 69d2270: Surface the Sandbox (the parallel prompt/model testing surface) end to end. Previously
  only the domain logic (`@cat-factory/sandbox`), wire contracts and kernel ports existed,
  with no way to use the feature; this wires the full stack:

  - **Services** (`@cat-factory/orchestration`): `SandboxService` (prompt-version lineage,
    fixture library with lazy builtin seeding, experiment definitions) + `SandboxRunService`
    (the run-driver + judge — expands an experiment matrix into cells, runs each inline
    candidate against the prompt-version's system text + the fixture input, grades it with a
    judge model against the task rubric, and records the deterministic objective findings
    score). Assembled as the `sandbox` core module when its repositories are wired.
  - **HTTP API** (`@cat-factory/server`): `SandboxController` mounts the prompt/fixture/
    experiment CRUD + `POST /sandbox/experiments/:id/launch`. 503 when unconfigured.
  - **Persistence**: the Sandbox gets its **own database** per runtime for blast-radius
    isolation — a dedicated `SANDBOX_DB` D1 database on the Cloudflare Worker (its own
    `sandbox-migrations/` lineage) and a dedicated `sandbox` Postgres schema on Node
    (Drizzle). Both runtimes contribute the repositories via a single sandbox-owned
    `Partial<CoreDependencies>` mixin, so neither facade enumerates them. Cross-runtime
    conformance asserts parity.
  - **Frontend** (`@cat-factory/app`): a Sandbox window (opened from the sidebar +
    command palette) to clone/version prompts, browse graded fixtures, and define + run
    experiments with a scored results grid.

  BREAKING (deployment): the Cloudflare Worker reads an optional new `SANDBOX_DB` binding;
  without it the Sandbox API answers 503 (the rest of the product is unaffected). To enable
  it, provision a second D1 database and point the binding + its `migrations_dir` at the
  package's `sandbox-migrations/` (see `deploy/backend/wrangler.toml`). On Node the
  `sandbox` schema is created automatically by the boot migrator.

  Container/repo fixtures (a real checkout) are not yet supported by the in-product run
  driver and are refused at launch; the builtin fixtures are all inline.

  Run-driver hardening: a relaunch clears the prior result grid first (new
  `SandboxRunRepository`/`SandboxGradeRepository.removeByExperiment`, mirrored on D1 +
  Drizzle) instead of accumulating duplicate cells; the experiment's terminal status is
  derived from whether any cell was actually graded (`failed` when every candidate failed OR
  every grade failed — never a misleading `done` over a grid of unscored cells, and never
  left `running`); the token budget must be ≥ 1 (a `0` budget is rejected at create rather
  than silently failing every cell) and is documented as a soft cap enforced between cells;
  the judge model defaults to the deployment routing default (no hardcoded vendor) and
  requires an explicit `judgeModel` when none is configured (the experiment builder now
  exposes a judge-model picker so a deployment with no default still has recourse); an
  unparseable / empty / reasoning-only judge reply is now recorded as a grading **error** on
  the cell rather than silently flooring every dimension to the minimum (which read as a
  confident bottom-of-scale grade); the judge-reply JSON extractor — now the single robust
  `extractJson` promoted to `@cat-factory/kernel` and shared by the requirements reviewer, the
  document planner and the Sandbox judge (replacing two weaker object-only copies) — is
  string-literal aware, scans forward past any leading bracket whose span isn't valid JSON
  (so prose like `I weighed [the auth flow]: {…}` no longer defeats extraction for the
  object-returning reviewers), and falls back past a leading non-JSON code fence. The judge
  prompt appends the shared `FINAL_ANSWER_IN_REPLY` directive like the other parsed-reply
  agents, and the provider-for-scope resolution the Sandbox shares with the reviewers is now
  one `resolveScopedModelProvider` kernel helper instead of two copies. The Sandbox window now surfaces a
  non-503 load failure (with a retry) instead of rendering an empty, healthy-looking panel.
  The fixture↔kind mapping the UI filters by now lives on the `@cat-factory/sandbox` catalog
  (`SandboxAgentKindMeta.fixtureKinds`) instead of a parallel frontend switch. Concurrent
  launches of the same experiment are now serialised by an atomic
  `SandboxExperimentRepository.claimForRun` (a conditional transition to `running`, mirrored on
  D1 + Drizzle): only the winner clears + re-expands the result grid, so two simultaneous
  launches can't duplicate the grid or race the grid-clearing deletes, and the grid setup runs
  inside the terminal-status `finally` so a failure there can't strand the experiment
  `running`. The matrix cell cap is surfaced on the overview (`maxCells`) so the builder gates
  on the SAME limit instead of re-encoding the literal. NOTE: the run-driver still executes the
  matrix inline in the launch request (bounded by the cell cap + token budget); a durable
  fan-out (Workflows / pg-boss) for large matrices remains a follow-up.

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- fef2964: Add `@cat-factory/sandbox` and `@cat-factory/local-server` to the root `tsc -b`
  build graph (`backend/tsconfig.build.json`). They were publishable (`private: false`,
  `publishConfig.access: public`) and declared `files: ["dist"]`, but neither was
  referenced by the build graph nor pulled in transitively, so `pnpm build` (which
  `ci:publish` runs before `changeset publish`) never produced their `dist`. The last
  release therefore published both with only `package.json` + `LICENSE` and no code.
  This patch re-releases them with their built output. (`@cat-factory/consensus` was
  unaffected — it builds transitively via the cloudflare/node graphs.)

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 4fa5ed9: Re-release all publishable packages. The previous release bumped these on `main` but never reached npm (the publish job was never triggered), so npm is a release behind. This changeset re-triggers the release so every package publishes.
- Updated dependencies [4fa5ed9]
  - @cat-factory/agents@0.7.2
  - @cat-factory/contracts@0.7.2
  - @cat-factory/kernel@0.7.2
  - @cat-factory/sandbox-fixtures@0.7.2

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 7463cf2: Add `repository` metadata (url + monorepo `directory`) to every published package.json. npm provenance attestation rejected the previous release because `repository.url` was empty and could not be matched against the source repo; declaring it lets the publish (and provenance) succeed, and re-triggers publishing of all packages from the failed release.
- Updated dependencies [7463cf2]
  - @cat-factory/agents@0.7.1
  - @cat-factory/contracts@0.7.1
  - @cat-factory/kernel@0.7.1
  - @cat-factory/sandbox-fixtures@0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 21ca647: Foundation for the **Sandbox** — a parallel, opt-in surface for the organized
  testing of prompts and models. It answers "which model is best for this task?"
  (one prompt, many models) and "does a better prompt help?" (one model, many
  prompt versions).

  This change lands the isolated foundation only (no runtime wiring yet):

  - **`@cat-factory/sandbox`** (new, isolated package): the pure domain logic —
    the testable-agent-kind catalog with live baseline enumeration (read from
    `@cat-factory/agents`, never persisted), append-only prompt-version lineage
    (clone → versioned candidates + freeform labels), experiment-matrix expansion
    into run cells, and the judge rubrics (lifted from the benchmark harness) plus
    a deterministic objective-findings recall scorer. Nothing in the core product
    depends on this package, so the whole feature can be extracted later.
  - **`@cat-factory/contracts`**: Valibot wire contracts for sandbox prompt
    versions, fixtures, experiments, runs, and grades (`sandbox.ts`).
  - **`@cat-factory/kernel`**: the sandbox repository ports
    (`SandboxPromptVersionRepository`, `SandboxFixtureRepository`,
    `SandboxExperimentRepository`, `SandboxRunRepository`,
    `SandboxGradeRepository`) and the re-exported domain types.

  Follow-ups (per the approved design): the server controller, the durable
  fan-out run driver + judge/objective grading, D1 ⇄ Drizzle persistence with a
  conformance assertion, the dedicated fixture repo + ephemeral-branch lifecycle,
  and the lazy-loaded frontend section.

- c4ef995: Add **`@cat-factory/sandbox-fixtures`** — a published package of hand-authored,
  standardized, **graded** no-repo fixtures for the Sandbox, plus the asymmetric
  grading model that scores them.

  - **`@cat-factory/sandbox-fixtures`** (new): inline (text-only) agent inputs that
    need NO repository checkout — `requirements-review`, `clarity-review`, `reviewer`
    (code review), and architecture-proposal review (`architect-companion`) — each
    spanning a simple → complex range. Every fixture declares the genuine findings a
    strong answer should surface, each rated by **trickiness** (how hard to spot —
    catching it is a "wow") and **impact** (how bad to miss). The standardized
    `SandboxFixtureDefinition` projects to the wire `SandboxFixture` via
    `toSandboxFixture`. Depends only on `@cat-factory/contracts` so the published
    `@cat-factory/sandbox` can load it via `workspace:*`.
  - **`@cat-factory/contracts`** (breaking, pre-1.0): the `findings` fixture objective
    now carries graded `expectations` (`{ id, summary, trickiness, impact, matchHints }`)
    instead of a flat `expectedFindings: string[]`; the objective result records the
    asymmetric breakdown (`impactRecall`, `wowBonus`, `caught`/`total`,
    `missedHighImpact`). New `clarity` inline fixture kind.
  - **`@cat-factory/sandbox`**: loads the workspace builtin fixtures by default
    (`listBuiltinFixtures`, re-exporting `@cat-factory/sandbox-fixtures`); replaces the
    flat `scoreExpectedFindings` recall with `scoreExpectations` (impact-weighted miss
    penalty so missing something impactful hurts most, plus a trickiness-weighted "wow"
    bonus for catching the subtle items) and `renderExpectationBrief` for the judge;
    adds the `architecture-review` (`architect-companion`) catalog entry and a
    `suggestExperiment` helper that maps selected models × prompts × fixtures to a
    ready-to-create experiment for a selected agent.

  No CI cache list change is needed: the new package sits under
  `backend/packages/*`, already covered by the workflow's `node_modules` cache glob;
  it is added to the `backend/tsconfig.build.json` composite build graph (the
  incremental `.tsbuildinfo` cache) so it builds before its `@cat-factory/sandbox`
  consumer.
