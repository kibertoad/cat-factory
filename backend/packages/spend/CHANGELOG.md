### Minor Changes

- 636fcf3: Re-verify every curated model route against its serving provider, take the agent CLIs at their
  newest, and refresh the dependency tree.
  
  **A withdrawn route, caught by the pin checker.** OpenRouter has withdrawn the undated
  `qwen/qwen3.8-max` and now serves the dated `qwen/qwen3.8-max-0902` instead. That is the silent
  failure `scripts/check-openrouter-pins.mjs` exists for: nothing throws, `effectiveVariant` keeps
  choosing the gateway for a workspace holding only an OpenRouter key, and every dispatch fails on
  a dead slug. The two entries swap arms accordingly, and the floating entry is deliberately NOT
  re-pointed at the dated slug: following an alias onto a snapshot is the identity the pinned entry
  beside it exists to hold.
  
  **GLM-5.3 gains the two routes it was waiting for.** It shipped subscription-only because Z.ai
  had not yet released the weights; Workers AI picked it up on 2026-08-28 and OpenRouter serves
  `z-ai/glm-5.3` today. Both were read off the serving provider before being declared, and each
  carries that provider's own window rather than the vendor's headline figure: Workers AI
  1,048,576, OpenRouter 1,310,720, the coding plan 1M.
  
  **Qwen3.8 Flash joins the catalog**, on DashScope and OpenRouter. It is the cheapest 1M-window
  entry here that reads images, which is what earns it a curated slot rather than the dynamic
  OpenRouter catalog: it is the natural low-cost tier for the inline steps that reach for
  `glm-flash` today, and a per-token rate is what those steps are chosen on.
  
  **One pinned rate was understating the budget gate.** `openrouter:x-ai/grok-4.6` carried xAI's
  SHORT band ($2 / $6) with its cache tier left to derive, while the direct `xai:grok-4.6` row
  carried the long band as its comment explains. xAI bills a request whose prompt reaches 200K
  tokens entirely at the doubled rate and OpenRouter is a passthrough, so the gateway row now
  matches: a cache read was metering at 60% below the live rate on a route that really does record
  the class (`x-ai` is `auto-prefix` on the gateway). Every other pin came back at or above its
  live rate, and every curated `openrouter` context window matches what the gateway serves.
  
  **Two omissions re-checked rather than assumed.** GPT-6 Astra still declares no `bedrock` arm:
  Codex 0.153.3 did add Astra to the Bedrock picker, so the route demonstrably exists, but neither
  AWS nor OpenAI publishes the model id it addresses, and a `baseModelId` guessed from a
  neighbouring entry is precisely the dead pin repaired above. Still no separate "Astra Pro" entry
  either, though the reasoning has narrowed: OpenRouter has minted its own `openai/gpt-6-astra-pro`
  slug, while OpenAI's model doc states reasoning effort is a parameter on the single `gpt-6-astra`
  id and Codex has no such `--model` slug. A second entry could therefore carry one arm re-badging
  a model already here at byte-identical pricing, and the two-entry shape is for a choice made with
  the price in front of you.
  
  **Agent CLIs.** Pi 0.85.0 -> 0.85.1 and Claude Code 2.1.261 -> 2.1.263 take their newest releases
  ahead of the 24h age window, as the Dockerfile's standing note allows for those three pins. Codex
  holds at 0.153.4 (already newest) and both Pi extensions at 2.9.0. Playwright in the UI image goes
  1.62.1 -> 1.63.0 with `@playwright/test`. The executor image tag rolls to 1.154.0.
  
  **Dependency refresh.** Direct ranges plus a lockfile re-resolution: 56 resolved names moved, no
  package name added or dropped. Four holds are unchanged and were re-verified at HEAD rather than
  restated: vitest at 4.1.11 and wrangler at 4.124.0 (`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22.0 is
  still the newest and peers `vitest: ^4.1.0` while pinning that wrangler exactly),
  `@cloudflare/workers-types` at 5.20260815.1 (the resolved workerd's date), and frontend TypeScript
  at 6.0.3 (`vue-tsc` 3.3.11 calls `require.resolve('typescript/lib/tsc')`, which TS 7's exports map
  does not carry). Base images are unchanged: `node:26-trixie-slim` still resolves to the digest
  already pinned. GitHub Actions: `docker/setup-qemu-action` v4.2.0 -> v4.3.0, `pnpm/action-setup`
  v6.0.10 -> v6.1.0, `zizmorcore/zizmor-action` v0.6.2 -> v0.6.3.

### Minor Changes

- 386c4a2: Add GPT-6 Astra to the curated catalog, take the agent CLIs at their newest, and refresh the
  dependency tree.
  
  **GPT-6 Astra.** OpenAI's new flagship (2026-09-03) joins the catalog as `gpt-6-astra` with a
  Codex subscription arm and an OpenRouter pay-as-you-go arm, a 1.05M window and image input. The
  model id IS the Codex `--model` slug, the same rule the GPT-5.6 tiers already follow. Two shapes
  were decided by checking the routes rather than the announcement:
  
  - **No `bedrock` arm**, even though OpenAI named Bedrock among the launch-day routes. No published
    model card names the Bedrock **id** for Astra, and this catalog declares a flavour only once the
    route is verified to serve that exact model: a declared-but-absent route is selected by
    `effectiveVariant` and then fails at dispatch, with nothing upstream of the dispatch to catch it.
    The arm can be added, additively, when the id lands.
  - **No separate "Astra Pro" entry.** Pro is not a second model or a second API id: it is this same
    `gpt-6-astra` served with `reasoning.mode` set to `pro`, and it exists only inside the ChatGPT
    plans, never on the API or in Codex. An entry for it could only name a route nothing here can
    dispatch.
  
  Astra is priced at $10 / $50 per 1M, the most expensive model this catalog can select on either
  OpenAI route, so it gets its own `openai:` and `openrouter:` spend rows rather than metering
  against the bare provider fallback. Its cached input is $1, the same 0.1x read multiplier the
  GPT-5.6 tiers use, so the derived cache tiers are already exact. The 2x "Fast mode" rate is
  deliberately not modelled: nothing here dispatches it, and a row set to a mode we never request
  would over-meter every ordinary Astra run against the budget gate.
  
  The built-in `mdp_chatgpt` preset deliberately stays on `gpt-5.6-sol` this round. It names a
  vendor rather than a generation and is meant to roll forward as that vendor's flagship moves, but
  Astra is still rolling out per-organization: rolling the preset now would repoint every workspace
  holding it onto a model its subscription may not serve yet, and the failure would land at dispatch.
  It is a one-line roll-forward once the rollout completes.
  
  **Agent CLIs.** Claude Code 2.1.260 -> 2.1.261, Codex 0.153.2 -> 0.153.4 and Pi 0.84.4 -> 0.85.0
  all take their newest releases ahead of the 24h age window, as the Dockerfile's standing note
  allows for those three pins. The Codex pin now also carries a floor the catalog depends on: Astra
  resolves only from Codex 0.153.0 onward, and an older CLI answers `Unknown model` rather than
  falling back, so that coupling is recorded at both ends. Both Pi extensions are already newest at
  2.9.0. The executor image tag rolls to 1.152.0.
  
  **Dependency refresh.** Direct ranges plus a full lockfile re-resolution: 70 resolved names moved,
  no package name added or dropped. Four holds, each on a live constraint rather than caution, and
  the first three are one constraint at three levels:
  
  - vitest and `@vitest/coverage-v8` stay on 4.1.11: `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.22.0 is the
    newest release and still peers `vitest: ^4.1.0`.
  - wrangler holds at 4.124.0 for the sixth round, pinned exactly as a dependency of that same package.
  - `@cloudflare/workers-types` holds at 5.20260815.1, one level further down. Its version encodes a
    workerd DATE and the wrangler above pins `workerd@1.20260815.1`, so moving the types to
    5.20260904.1 would describe a runtime three weeks newer than the one that actually executes: an
    API added in the gap typechecks green and throws in production. That is the whole reason
    `check-cloudflare-runtime-pins` exists, and it is what caught the attempt.
  - TypeScript holds at 6.0.3 on the frontend, where `vue-tsc` resolves `typescript/lib/tsc`, which
    TS 7 no longer exports.

### Minor Changes

- cd220f2: Add five catalog models, take the agent CLIs at their newest, and refresh the dependency tree.
  
  **Five new curated models.** Claude Fable 5.1, Gemini 3.8 Flash, a pinned Qwen3.8-Max-0902
  snapshot, and Meta's Muse Spark 1.3 in both of its commercial tiers. Every route was checked
  against the serving provider's live catalogue before it was declared, which is what decided three
  of the shapes:
  
  - **Claude Fable 5.1** is the first Claude entry carrying subscription, OpenRouter and Bedrock arms
    at once. Bedrock listed `anthropic.claude-fable-5-1` on Anthropic's own launch day rather than a
    generation behind, so the flavour is declared against a verified route. Its OpenRouter slug is
    DOTTED (`anthropic/claude-fable-5.1`) where the API id is dashed; the two genuinely disagree and
    normalising either spelling yields a dead id.
  - **Qwen3.8-Max-0902** is DashScope-only. OpenRouter serves the undated alias and publishes no dated
    slug, and a flavour declared before its route exists is picked by `effectiveVariant` and then
    fails at dispatch. It is a separate entry rather than a repoint of `qwen3.8-max` for the reason
    `claude-opus-4-8` is separate: a block pinned to a snapshot must keep getting that build.
  - **Muse Spark 1.3 ships as TWO entries**, standard and contributor. They are the same model on the
    same route and differ only in what Meta may do with the traffic: the contributor tier costs a
    twelfth on input in exchange for Meta training on the prompts and completions. That is a choice
    an operator has to make with the price in front of them, and one entry could only make it
    silently, so the two prices sit in separate rows and the SPA's "enable recommended" set omits the
    contributor slug.
  
  `meta` joins the OpenRouter vendor-prefix family map beside `meta-llama`, so an account that blocks
  the Meta family blocks Muse Spark too rather than leaving it unclassified.
  
  **The bare `bedrock` price row moved up a tier**, from ~$5/$30 to ~$10/$50 per 1M. A Bedrock ref
  carries the account's own geo prefix, so `priceFor` can only ever match the bare provider key, and
  that row is deliberately set to the frontier tier the catalog can select there. Fable 5.1 moved that
  ceiling; leaving the row behind would have metered every Fable-5.1-on-Bedrock run at half its cost.
  
  **Both runner image tags roll**: the executor to 1.150.0 for the CLI bumps, and the deploy image
  to 0.6.2 because the dependency round moved `@types/node` in its `package.json`, which the image
  builds from. A dep bump inside a harness IS an image-source change, and republishing over a live
  tag does not roll a deployment out.
  
  **Agent CLIs at their newest, ahead of the age window**, as the Dockerfile's standing note allows
  for exactly these pins: Claude Code 2.1.252 -> 2.1.260 and Codex 0.152.0 -> 0.153.2. Pi is already
  at its newest (0.84.4). Both Pi extensions move 2.8.0 -> 2.9.0 and have aged past the window, so
  they take the ordinary route.
  
  **Dependency refresh**: direct ranges plus a lockfile re-resolution, so transitives move to the
  newest release each declared range already admits under the `minimumReleaseAge` gate. 68 resolved
  names move and the re-resolve adds and drops nothing, leaving 1388 names on both sides. Direct:
  the `@ai-sdk/*` line (`amazon-bedrock@^5.0.73`, `anthropic@^4.0.49`, `openai@^4.0.57`,
  `openai-compatible@^3.0.43`, `provider@^4.0.10`), `ai@^7.0.91`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3@^3.1125.0`, the
  `@opentelemetry/*` set (`0.222.0` exporters, `2.11.0` SDK), `@types/node@^26.4.1`,
  `happy-dom@^20.13.2`, `knip@^6.34.0`, `oxfmt@^0.66.0`, `oxlint@^1.81.0`, `undici@^8.10.1`. The AI
  SDK family stays inside the `ai@^7` + `@ai-sdk/*@^4` majors that pair with `workers-ai-provider`.
  
  Three holds, each for a reason rather than for the age window:
  
  - **TypeScript stays at 6.0.3 on the frontend** while the backend is already on 7.0.2. TS 7 was
    tried and reverted: `vue-tsc@3.3.11` resolves `typescript/lib/tsc`, which TS 7 no longer exports,
    so the typecheck dies with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` before reading a single file. vue-tsc
    is the real gate for `.vue`, so the frontend moves when vue-tsc does.
  - **wrangler holds at 4.124.0 and `@cloudflare/workers-types` at 5.20260815.1** for the fifth round
    running. `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0` is still the newest pool and still pins wrangler
    exactly; the types version IS the workerd date that pin resolves.
  - **`@types/node@26.4.0` and `undici@8.10.0` keep a second resolved copy** beside the new ones, held
    by upstream ranges (`@types/pg`, `happy-dom`, `nuxt`, `unifont`) rather than by anything here.
  
  Also re-pins `openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, the one row `check-openrouter-pins.mjs`
  reported as metering BELOW the live rate. The alias drifted up ~9% since the 2026-09-01 read, and a
  budget gate is allowed to be early but never short.

### Minor Changes

- 4d999cb: Treat OpenRouter as the gateway it is, rather than as one more OpenAI-compatible vendor.
  
  **Its own client.** `openrouter` now resolves through `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
  (`openRouterResolver`) instead of the generic `createOpenAICompatible`; every other
  OpenAI-compatible provider is unchanged. The dispatch is made once, in
  `directOpenAiCompatibleResolver`, which both entry points that build a provider from a leased key
  route through.
  
  **Cost and upstream are now RECORDED rather than derived.** Usage accounting is requested on both
  model paths, so `llm_call_metrics` gains `reported_cost_usd` (the gateway's own USD ledger figure)
  and `upstream_provider` (which vendor actually served the call). Both are nullable and null is
  load-bearing: every other cost on the table is derived from the spend price table, so a 0 would
  report an unpriced call as free. **Break:** the two columns are added to the D1 telemetry store, the
  Postgres `telemetry` schema and local mode's SQLite store; existing rows read NULL, which is the
  correct answer for them.
  
  **`supportsStructuredOutputs` is now set** on the generic OpenAI-compatible client for the cloud
  VENDORS. Without it the SDK silently rewrites a schema-carrying request to `{ type: 'json_object' }`
  and drops the schema. Nothing in this repo passes a schema today, so this closes a trap rather than
  changing behaviour. It is withheld from the upstreams nobody here can vouch for: per-user local
  runners (which never come through this path anyway) and the operator-hosted `bifrost` / `litellm`
  gateways, whose model ids are the operator's own aliases and routinely front an Ollama or vLLM
  model that answers a `json_schema` request with a 400.
  
  **The `/models` catalog reads what it was dropping**: the conditional `overrides` pricing bands
  (folded to their maximum), both cache classes and the 1-hour write fallback, `expiration_date` and
  `canonical_slug`. A published cache rate now reaches the spend table instead of the derived
  multiplier, unless it is zero, which cannot be told apart from a placeholder for a class the
  gateway does not bill separately and would meter every cache hit free. A model's withdrawal date
  is shown in the catalog picker.
  
  **Prompt caching is no longer reported as absent for every gateway model.** `providerCachePolicy`
  takes the model, so an `openrouter:deepseek/…` slug resolves to the policy stated for its vendor
  prefix. Those are stated per prefix rather than borrowed from the direct provider of the same
  name, because the two genuinely differ: OpenRouter's Moonshot route caches automatically while our
  direct `moonshot` does not, and its Alibaba route needs explicit breakpoints while direct Qwen
  does not. Anthropic (and now Qwen) behind a gateway stays `none`, because nothing on that path
  sends `cache_control`. **Break:** the rule moved from `@cat-factory/kernel` to
  `@cat-factory/contracts` (kernel re-exports it unchanged) so the SPA can read the same function
  instead of mirroring it in a Vue constant, which had already drifted.
  
  **Two new env vars, because both routing constraints can empty the upstream pool.**
  `OPENROUTER_DATA_COLLECTION` (default `deny`, stricter than the vendor's own) is whether OpenRouter
  may route to a prompt-retaining upstream; `OPENROUTER_REQUIRE_PARAMETERS` (default `true`) is
  whether it must route only to an upstream advertising every parameter the request carries. A pool
  narrowed to nothing is a 404, not a degraded call, so the proxy recognises that refusal and records
  which constraint could have caused it: the gateway cannot say, since our request is the only place
  both are stated.
  
  **New check `scripts/check-openrouter-pins.mjs`** re-reads the live catalogue against the spend
  table's pinned slugs, comparing all three pinned classes: input, output, and the cache-READ rate a
  row names only where the vendor departs from the derived floor (so nothing else follows it when the
  vendor moves). Its runs found four pins metering below the live rate, one
  (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`) by nearly 3x; all four are repinned here.
  
  **Reported cost and upstream are rendered**, in the observability panel's call list: the upstream
  beside `provider:model`, the gateway's own figure in the expanded row. They stay out of the spend
  rollups, which remain derived end to end, because a rollup mixing a measured figure for one
  provider's rows with an estimate for the rest answers a different question per row.
  
  **The inline instrumented provider now REFUSES to stream** rather than passing an unrecorded call
  through. Nothing inline streams today (the recorder hard-codes `streaming: false` for that reason),
  and a streamed call would have reached no sink at all, which downstream is indistinguishable from a
  step that spent nothing.
