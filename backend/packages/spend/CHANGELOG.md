### Minor Changes

- 3546e3d: Move operator/integration config out of environment variables into encrypted, UI-editable
  DB settings. DB is now the source of truth — the moved env vars are **removed** (no
  fallback), so the listed vars below no longer have any effect.

  **Per-workspace budget (Workspace settings → Budget).** A workspace's spend currency,
  monthly limit, and per-model price overrides now live on the `workspace_settings` row.
  The spend safeguard resolves each workspace's effective pricing (base table + overrides)
  behind a short-TTL cache, scoping the budget gate to the workspace's own usage
  (`SpendService.status`/`isOverBudget` now take a `workspaceId`; new
  `TokenUsageRepository.totalsSinceForWorkspace`). **Behaviour change:** spend is metered +
  gated per workspace, not deployment-wide; a workspace with no budget inherits the built-in
  default (~100 EUR/month). Removes env: `SPEND_MONTHLY_LIMIT`, `SPEND_CURRENCY`,
  `SPEND_MODEL_PRICES`. A budget of `0` is intentional ("no PAID spend"): metered runs are
  refused **up front** at start/retry with a clear `409` (not just a silent mid-run pause),
  while LOCAL-runner models (keyless) and connected SUBSCRIPTIONS (flat-rate quota) keep
  running since they incur no metered cost — so `0` is the "local-/subscription-only" setting.
  The over-budget exemption (previously subscription-only) now also covers local-runner steps,
  inline and container alike. The hot-path per-workspace rollup is indexed
  (`idx_token_usage_workspace` on `(workspace_id, created_at)`, both runtimes).

  **Per-workspace incident enrichment (service inspector → Post-release health).** PagerDuty

  - incident.io credentials are sealed in a new per-workspace `incident_enrichment_connections`
    table (one grouped blob) and resolved/decrypted at enrichment time by a new
    `WorkspaceIncidentEnrichmentProvider`. Removes env: `PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN`,
    `PAGERDUTY_FROM_EMAIL`, `INCIDENTIO_API_KEY`. The write API is three-state per provider
    group (omit ⇒ keep, `null` ⇒ clear, value ⇒ set) so one vendor can be removed without
    wiping the other.

  **Per-account integration secrets (Account settings → Deployment integrations, admin only).**
  The Slack app OAuth credentials and the container web-search upstream keys (Brave /
  SearXNG) now live in a new per-account `account_settings` table (one sealed secrets blob,
  HKDF tag `cat-factory:account-settings`), behind an admin-gated
  `GET|PUT /accounts/:id/settings`. Resolved dynamically: Slack OAuth at connect time, the
  web-search upstream per run (off the container session's account id). The executor now
  advertises the container `web_search` tool to a run **only when its account actually has
  keys** (so an agent is never handed a tool that always fails); a run with no upstream gets
  an empty result set rather than a hard `503`. Removes env:
  `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SLACK_REDIRECT_URL`, `WEB_SEARCH_BRAVE_API_KEY`,
  `WEB_SEARCH_SEARXNG_URL`, `WEB_SEARCH_SEARXNG_API_KEY` (the env-built upstream + its
  `createWebSearchUpstreamFromEnv`/`gateways.webSearch` fallback are deleted, not just
  unwired). (`SLACK_ENABLED` still gates Slack module assembly; the new tables/services
  assemble whenever `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set.)

  **Hardening.** Re-sealing a partial settings/credentials write now **refuses** (clear `409`)
  when the stored blob can't be decrypted (e.g. after an encryption-key change) instead of
  silently dropping the un-edited secret group on the re-seal.

  New tables mirror across both runtimes (D1 migrations 0012–0014 ⇄ Drizzle schema +
  generated migration) with cross-runtime conformance assertions for the budget +
  incident-enrichment round-trips. `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`, and the GitHub
  App/OAuth secrets stay in env (bootstrap/auth). Retention windows, inline-web-search
  toggles, Langfuse keys, and execution timeouts intentionally remain env-configured.

### Patch Changes

- 2aae8bc: Fix the OpenRouter key panel falsely reporting "connected" on a rejected key, and add Kimi K2.7 as a curated OpenRouter model.

  - The OpenRouter setup panel (`OpenRouterCatalogPanel`) used to fire its "OpenRouter key connected" success toast — and flip the panel into the connected state — _before_ probing OpenRouter, since the save endpoint stores keys without validating them. A wrong/expired key therefore showed a 401 "could not reach OpenRouter" toast **and** a "connected" status simultaneously. `connectKey` now probes OpenRouter with the freshly stored key first, only announces success when it's reachable, and rolls the key back on rejection so the form stays for a retry. (The Vendors & keys → Proxies screen shares the same store-only save codepath; it never showed the bug because it doesn't probe OpenRouter after saving.)
  - `kimi-k2.7` now carries an `openrouter` flavour (`moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`, 256K context per OpenRouter's catalog), so it routes through the OpenRouter gateway out of the box once an OpenRouter key is connected. It's added to the OpenRouter panel's "Enable recommended" slugs and the spend price table (billed at Moonshot's upstream rates).

### Minor Changes

- ae29687: OpenRouter: dynamic multi-tenant catalog + flavour unification.

  **Flavour unification.** A catalog model can now carry an `openrouter` flavour alongside
  `cloudflare`/`direct`/`subscription`. `effectiveVariant` resolves in the precedence
  direct → openrouter → cloudflare (the subscription override still wins in `ModelRouter`),
  so the SAME logical model routes through OpenRouter when only an OpenRouter key is
  configured, and through its native vendor when that key is present. The standalone
  `openrouter-*` catalog entries are folded into their native twins: `deepseek`, `gpt-5.5`
  and `claude-opus` gain an `openrouter` route; Gemini 3 Pro becomes a curated `gemini`
  entry. **Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable):** the catalog ids `openrouter-claude-opus`,
  `openrouter-gpt`, `openrouter-deepseek`, `openrouter-gemini-pro` and `openrouter-llama`
  are removed — a block pinned to one falls through to default routing.

  **Dynamic catalog.** A workspace can now browse OpenRouter's live `/models` and enable a
  subset in the UI (the new "OpenRouter models" panel), rather than a hardcoded handful.
  Enabled models surface in the per-workspace picker as `openrouter:<slug>` entries with
  their live context window and price (overlaid onto the spend table, so budgets meter
  accurately). Persisted in a new generic per-workspace `provider_model_catalog` table
  (D1 ⇄ Drizzle, keyed by `(workspace_id, provider)` so future gateways like LiteLLM reuse
  it), behind the new kernel `ProviderModelCatalogRepository` port and the
  `OpenRouterCatalogService` (refresh leases the workspace's pooled OpenRouter key). New
  routes: `GET|PUT /workspaces/:ws/openrouter/catalog`, `POST /workspaces/:ws/openrouter/refresh`.
  Cross-runtime conformance asserts the enabled-subset round-trip + catalog surfacing on
  both D1 and Postgres.

### Patch Changes

- a0a1bcc: Add Kimi K2.5 (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`) to the model catalog as a Cloudflare-only
  entry (256K context) with its spend pricing. Cloudflare lists K2.5 at $0.60 in / $3.00
  out per 1M, below the K2.6/K2.7 rate, so without an explicit price entry it would fall
  back to the near-free `workers-ai` neuron rate and meter at ~0.

  Default the `conflict-resolver` agent kind to Kimi K2.5 on both runtimes (Worker + Node).
  The conflict-resolver rewrites conflicted hunks against the base, a focused diff-heavy
  reasoning task the small default MoE handles poorly. Operators can still override via
  `AGENT_MODELS`.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 4fa5ed9: Re-release all publishable packages. The previous release bumped these on `main` but never reached npm (the publish job was never triggered), so npm is a release behind. This changeset re-triggers the release so every package publishes.

### Patch Changes

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a08935: Add **OpenRouter** and **LiteLLM** as model providers. Both are OpenAI-compatible, so
  they reuse the existing inlined `openAiCompatibleResolver` path (no new dependency, no
  dedicated package) and work for both inline engine calls and container coding agents via
  the LLM proxy. Keys are onboarded per workspace/user through the UI key pool like the
  other direct vendors; their base URLs are deployment config — OpenRouter defaults to the
  public gateway (`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` override optional), while LiteLLM is operator-hosted
  so `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is required to enable it. Ships curated, direct-only catalog entries
  (OpenRouter: Claude Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.5, DeepSeek, Llama 3.3; LiteLLM: a generic
  gateway-default entry) with approximate pricing/context, overridable via
  `SPEND_MODEL_PRICES`.

  Catalog selectability now also gates on a **resolvable base URL**: an OpenAI-compatible
  provider (everything but `openai`/`anthropic`) is only offered once its base URL resolves,
  so a LiteLLM model stays unselectable — and a pipeline using it is blocked at start —
  until `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is set, instead of passing the guard and throwing "No base URL
  configured" mid-run. Wired symmetrically into both facades' capability resolution.

  **Wire change:** `apiKeyProviderSchema` is widened with `'openrouter'` and `'litellm'`.

- 6406c8c: Extract `@cat-factory/spend` — pricing tables and spend metering/gating are now a standalone package. `@cat-factory/core` re-exports the full public surface for backward compatibility; the acceptance test and worker's spending config now import directly from `@cat-factory/spend`, narrowing the CI container-acceptance gate from `backend/packages/core/**` to `backend/packages/spend/**`.

### Patch Changes

- 8eed38c: Author relative imports with explicit `.js` extensions across the shared backend
  packages so their emitted `dist` is directly resolvable by Node's ESM loader (no
  bundler required). This lets the Node runtime run the built output on plain Node
  (`node dist/main.js`) — no tsx, no esbuild bundle — and is inert for the Cloudflare
  Worker (wrangler bundles regardless). `handlebars/runtime` is imported as
  `handlebars/runtime.js` for the same reason (its type is sourced from the full
  package, type-only). No behaviour or public-API change.
- 7c37653: Expand the model picker, route AI Gateway catalog models, and default the
  implementer (coder) to the latest Kimi.

  - The picker catalog (`MODEL_CATALOG`) gains three Cloudflare-served entries:
    `kimi-k2.7` (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`), `glm` (`@cf/zai-org/glm-5.2`,
    262K context) and `deepseek-v4-pro` (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, 131K context).
    The existing DeepSeek reasoning entry is relabelled `DeepSeek R1`.
  - The Workers AI upstream now serves `<provider>/<model>` AI-catalog slugs like
    `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (a unified-billing run-catalog model Cloudflare serves
    via Fireworks) by calling `binding.run` directly in the OpenAI Chat Completions
    shape, with the account's own token — no AI Gateway, no BYOK. A `@cf/...` Workers AI
    id is unaffected (still routed through the AI SDK).
  - The build phase (`coder`) now defaults to Kimi K2.7 instead of GLM-5.2. GLM-5.2
    on Workers AI was observed emitting malformed tool calls (`write` with no `path`)
    and looping until the harness no-progress guard aborted; design/review
    (`architect`/`reviewer`) stay on GLM-5.2. Operators can still override per kind
    via `AGENT_MODELS`.
  - Spend pricing gains an approximate entry for `workers-ai:deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`
    (a partner model billed at provider rates, not the near-free neuron rate).

- 56ee67d: Price Cloudflare Workers AI Kimi models (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` and
  `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`) at Cloudflare's published Workers AI per-token
  rate ($0.95 in / $4.00 out per 1M, USD→EUR ~0.92) instead of letting them fall
  through to the near-free `workers-ai` neuron rate. Kimi K2.7 is the default coder,
  so without explicit `workers-ai:@cf/moonshotai/...` entries every Cloudflare-Kimi
  run metered at 0.1/0.1 EUR per million tokens and showed spend as ~0.00. Mirrors
  the existing partner-model exception for `deepseek-v4-pro`.
- 5ca8086: Add alternate subscription-backed coding harnesses (Claude Code / Codex) alongside
  the Pi proxy harness.

  - New per-workspace **subscription token pool** (`provider_subscription_tokens`,
    D1 + Postgres, encrypted at rest) with usage-aware rotation, behind a kernel
    port + `ProviderSubscriptionService`, wired into all three runtimes.
  - A guided **LLM Vendors** navbar UI to connect Claude / Codex / GLM (Z.ai) /
    Kimi (Moonshot) / DeepSeek subscription credentials (token pool, write-only).
    GLM / Kimi / DeepSeek all run via Claude Code against the vendor's
    Anthropic-compatible endpoint; the unfiltered credential list covers every vendor.
  - The executor-harness image now bundles the Claude Code and Codex CLIs; the
    harness selects `pi` / `claude-code` / `codex` per job from the model, and the
    subscription harnesses authenticate direct-to-vendor (no proxy) and report token
    usage from the CLI event stream for rotation + telemetry.
  - The model catalog becomes a canonical-model → provider map with precedence
    **subscription > direct > cloudflare** ("subscriptions always win"): latest
    Opus/Sonnet + GPT-5.5/5.4 (subscription-only), GLM-5.2/Kimi gain a Claude-Code
    subscription flavour, and `ModelOption` now carries per-flavour cost, context
    window, and a `quotaBased` flag (subscription usage is flat-rate quota, never
    billed against the spend budget).
  - A block's model is shared by all its pipeline steps, so a pin to a subscription-only
    model (Claude Code / Codex — container-only, no provider key) is degraded to the
    step's env-routing default for every INLINE LLM path through one shared seam
    (`inlineModelRef` / `resolveInlineModelRef`): both the inline agent executor and the
    requirements reviewer/rework, so the inline steps run instead of hard-failing and the
    two paths can't drift. The claude-code subscription harness repairs malformed
    structured output through the vendor's own Anthropic-compatible endpoint (the Pi
    harness still uses the proxy; Codex keeps the graceful no-repair path).
  - Hardening: the per-vendor token pool is capped to bound growth; the leased
    subscription credential is scrubbed from subscription-repair error details (not just
    GitHub-shaped secrets); and Codex token usage is read from its cumulative
    `total_token_usage` so multi-turn runs attribute usage correctly for rotation.
