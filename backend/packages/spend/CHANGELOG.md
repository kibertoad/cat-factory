# @cat-factory/spend

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a08935: Add **OpenRouter** and **LiteLLM** as model providers. Both are OpenAI-compatible, so
  they reuse the existing inlined `openAiCompatibleResolver` path (no new dependency, no
  dedicated package) and work for both inline engine calls and container coding agents via
  the LLM proxy. Keys are onboarded per workspace/user through the UI key pool like the
  other direct vendors; their base URLs are deployment config — OpenRouter defaults to the
  public gateway (`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` override optional), while LiteLLM is operator-hosted
  so `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is required to enable it. Ships curated, direct-only catalog entries
  (OpenRouter: Claude Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.5, DeepSeek, Llama 3.3; LiteLLM: a generic
  gateway-default entry) with approximate pricing/context, overridable via
  `SPEND_MODEL_PRICES`.

  Catalog selectability now also gates on a **resolvable base URL**: an OpenAI-compatible
  provider (everything but `openai`/`anthropic`) is only offered once its base URL resolves,
  so a LiteLLM model stays unselectable — and a pipeline using it is blocked at start —
  until `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is set, instead of passing the guard and throwing "No base URL
  configured" mid-run. Wired symmetrically into both facades' capability resolution.

  **Wire change:** `apiKeyProviderSchema` is widened with `'openrouter'` and `'litellm'`.

- 6406c8c: Extract `@cat-factory/spend` — pricing tables and spend metering/gating are now a standalone package. `@cat-factory/core` re-exports the full public surface for backward compatibility; the acceptance test and worker's spending config now import directly from `@cat-factory/spend`, narrowing the CI container-acceptance gate from `backend/packages/core/**` to `backend/packages/spend/**`.

### Patch Changes

- 8eed38c: Author relative imports with explicit `.js` extensions across the shared backend
  packages so their emitted `dist` is directly resolvable by Node's ESM loader (no
  bundler required). This lets the Node runtime run the built output on plain Node
  (`node dist/main.js`) — no tsx, no esbuild bundle — and is inert for the Cloudflare
  Worker (wrangler bundles regardless). `handlebars/runtime` is imported as
  `handlebars/runtime.js` for the same reason (its type is sourced from the full
  package, type-only). No behaviour or public-API change.
- 7c37653: Expand the model picker, route AI Gateway catalog models, and default the
  implementer (coder) to the latest Kimi.

  - The picker catalog (`MODEL_CATALOG`) gains three Cloudflare-served entries:
    `kimi-k2.7` (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`), `glm` (`@cf/zai-org/glm-5.2`,
    262K context) and `deepseek-v4-pro` (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, 131K context).
    The existing DeepSeek reasoning entry is relabelled `DeepSeek R1`.
  - The Workers AI upstream now serves `<provider>/<model>` AI-catalog slugs like
    `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (a unified-billing run-catalog model Cloudflare serves
    via Fireworks) by calling `binding.run` directly in the OpenAI Chat Completions
    shape, with the account's own token — no AI Gateway, no BYOK. A `@cf/...` Workers AI
    id is unaffected (still routed through the AI SDK).
  - The build phase (`coder`) now defaults to Kimi K2.7 instead of GLM-5.2. GLM-5.2
    on Workers AI was observed emitting malformed tool calls (`write` with no `path`)
    and looping until the harness no-progress guard aborted; design/review
    (`architect`/`reviewer`) stay on GLM-5.2. Operators can still override per kind
    via `AGENT_MODELS`.
  - Spend pricing gains an approximate entry for `workers-ai:deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`
    (a partner model billed at provider rates, not the near-free neuron rate).

- 56ee67d: Price Cloudflare Workers AI Kimi models (`@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` and
  `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`) at Cloudflare's published Workers AI per-token
  rate ($0.95 in / $4.00 out per 1M, USD→EUR ~0.92) instead of letting them fall
  through to the near-free `workers-ai` neuron rate. Kimi K2.7 is the default coder,
  so without explicit `workers-ai:@cf/moonshotai/...` entries every Cloudflare-Kimi
  run metered at 0.1/0.1 EUR per million tokens and showed spend as ~0.00. Mirrors
  the existing partner-model exception for `deepseek-v4-pro`.
- 5ca8086: Add alternate subscription-backed coding harnesses (Claude Code / Codex) alongside
  the Pi proxy harness.

  - New per-workspace **subscription token pool** (`provider_subscription_tokens`,
    D1 + Postgres, encrypted at rest) with usage-aware rotation, behind a kernel
    port + `ProviderSubscriptionService`, wired into all three runtimes.
  - A guided **LLM Vendors** navbar UI to connect Claude / Codex / GLM (Z.ai) /
    Kimi (Moonshot) / DeepSeek subscription credentials (token pool, write-only).
    GLM / Kimi / DeepSeek all run via Claude Code against the vendor's
    Anthropic-compatible endpoint; the unfiltered credential list covers every vendor.
  - The executor-harness image now bundles the Claude Code and Codex CLIs; the
    harness selects `pi` / `claude-code` / `codex` per job from the model, and the
    subscription harnesses authenticate direct-to-vendor (no proxy) and report token
    usage from the CLI event stream for rotation + telemetry.
  - The model catalog becomes a canonical-model → provider map with precedence
    **subscription > direct > cloudflare** ("subscriptions always win"): latest
    Opus/Sonnet + GPT-5.5/5.4 (subscription-only), GLM-5.2/Kimi gain a Claude-Code
    subscription flavour, and `ModelOption` now carries per-flavour cost, context
    window, and a `quotaBased` flag (subscription usage is flat-rate quota, never
    billed against the spend budget).
  - A block's model is shared by all its pipeline steps, so a pin to a subscription-only
    model (Claude Code / Codex — container-only, no provider key) is degraded to the
    step's env-routing default for every INLINE LLM path through one shared seam
    (`inlineModelRef` / `resolveInlineModelRef`): both the inline agent executor and the
    requirements reviewer/rework, so the inline steps run instead of hard-failing and the
    two paths can't drift. The claude-code subscription harness repairs malformed
    structured output through the vendor's own Anthropic-compatible endpoint (the Pi
    harness still uses the proxy; Codex keeps the graceful no-repair path).
  - Hardening: the per-vendor token pool is capped to bound growth; the leased
    subscription credential is scrubbed from subscription-repair error details (not just
    GitHub-shaped secrets); and Codex token usage is read from its cumulative
    `total_token_usage` so multi-turn runs attribute usage correctly for rotation.
