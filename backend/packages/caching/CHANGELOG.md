- cd220f2: Add five catalog models, take the agent CLIs at their newest, and refresh the dependency tree.
  
  **Five new curated models.** Claude Fable 5.1, Gemini 3.8 Flash, a pinned Qwen3.8-Max-0902
  snapshot, and Meta's Muse Spark 1.3 in both of its commercial tiers. Every route was checked
  against the serving provider's live catalogue before it was declared, which is what decided three
  of the shapes:
  
  - **Claude Fable 5.1** is the first Claude entry carrying subscription, OpenRouter and Bedrock arms
    at once. Bedrock listed `anthropic.claude-fable-5-1` on Anthropic's own launch day rather than a
    generation behind, so the flavour is declared against a verified route. Its OpenRouter slug is
    DOTTED (`anthropic/claude-fable-5.1`) where the API id is dashed; the two genuinely disagree and
    normalising either spelling yields a dead id.
  - **Qwen3.8-Max-0902** is DashScope-only. OpenRouter serves the undated alias and publishes no dated
    slug, and a flavour declared before its route exists is picked by `effectiveVariant` and then
    fails at dispatch. It is a separate entry rather than a repoint of `qwen3.8-max` for the reason
    `claude-opus-4-8` is separate: a block pinned to a snapshot must keep getting that build.
  - **Muse Spark 1.3 ships as TWO entries**, standard and contributor. They are the same model on the
    same route and differ only in what Meta may do with the traffic: the contributor tier costs a
    twelfth on input in exchange for Meta training on the prompts and completions. That is a choice
    an operator has to make with the price in front of them, and one entry could only make it
    silently, so the two prices sit in separate rows and the SPA's "enable recommended" set omits the
    contributor slug.
  
  `meta` joins the OpenRouter vendor-prefix family map beside `meta-llama`, so an account that blocks
  the Meta family blocks Muse Spark too rather than leaving it unclassified.
  
  **The bare `bedrock` price row moved up a tier**, from ~$5/$30 to ~$10/$50 per 1M. A Bedrock ref
  carries the account's own geo prefix, so `priceFor` can only ever match the bare provider key, and
  that row is deliberately set to the frontier tier the catalog can select there. Fable 5.1 moved that
  ceiling; leaving the row behind would have metered every Fable-5.1-on-Bedrock run at half its cost.
  
  **Both runner image tags roll**: the executor to 1.150.0 for the CLI bumps, and the deploy image
  to 0.6.2 because the dependency round moved `@types/node` in its `package.json`, which the image
  builds from. A dep bump inside a harness IS an image-source change, and republishing over a live
  tag does not roll a deployment out.
  
  **Agent CLIs at their newest, ahead of the age window**, as the Dockerfile's standing note allows
  for exactly these pins: Claude Code 2.1.252 -> 2.1.260 and Codex 0.152.0 -> 0.153.2. Pi is already
  at its newest (0.84.4). Both Pi extensions move 2.8.0 -> 2.9.0 and have aged past the window, so
  they take the ordinary route.
  
  **Dependency refresh**: direct ranges plus a lockfile re-resolution, so transitives move to the
  newest release each declared range already admits under the `minimumReleaseAge` gate. 68 resolved
  names move and the re-resolve adds and drops nothing, leaving 1388 names on both sides. Direct:
  the `@ai-sdk/*` line (`amazon-bedrock@^5.0.73`, `anthropic@^4.0.49`, `openai@^4.0.57`,
  `openai-compatible@^3.0.43`, `provider@^4.0.10`), `ai@^7.0.91`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3@^3.1125.0`, the
  `@opentelemetry/*` set (`0.222.0` exporters, `2.11.0` SDK), `@types/node@^26.4.1`,
  `happy-dom@^20.13.2`, `knip@^6.34.0`, `oxfmt@^0.66.0`, `oxlint@^1.81.0`, `undici@^8.10.1`. The AI
  SDK family stays inside the `ai@^7` + `@ai-sdk/*@^4` majors that pair with `workers-ai-provider`.
  
  Three holds, each for a reason rather than for the age window:
  
  - **TypeScript stays at 6.0.3 on the frontend** while the backend is already on 7.0.2. TS 7 was
    tried and reverted: `vue-tsc@3.3.11` resolves `typescript/lib/tsc`, which TS 7 no longer exports,
    so the typecheck dies with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` before reading a single file. vue-tsc
    is the real gate for `.vue`, so the frontend moves when vue-tsc does.
  - **wrangler holds at 4.124.0 and `@cloudflare/workers-types` at 5.20260815.1** for the fifth round
    running. `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0` is still the newest pool and still pins wrangler
    exactly; the types version IS the workerd date that pin resolves.
  - **`@types/node@26.4.0` and `undici@8.10.0` keep a second resolved copy** beside the new ones, held
    by upstream ranges (`@types/pg`, `happy-dom`, `nuxt`, `unifont`) rather than by anything here.
  
  Also re-pins `openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, the one row `check-openrouter-pins.mjs`
  reported as metering BELOW the live rate. The alias drifted up ~9% since the 2026-09-01 read, and a
  budget gate is allowed to be early but never short.

### Patch Changes

- 0f426b3: Refresh the dependency tree and the bundled agent CLIs.
  
  **Direct ranges plus a lockfile re-resolution from an empty tree**, so transitives move to the
  newest release each declared range already admits, under the `minimumReleaseAge` gate:
  
  - **Direct**: `ai@^7.0.84 → ^7.0.85`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic@^4.0.45 → ^4.0.46`,
    `@ai-sdk/openai@^4.0.51 → ^4.0.52`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@^3.0.40 → ^3.0.41`,
    `@ai-sdk/provider@^4.0.8 → ^4.0.9`, `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock@^5.0.67 → ^5.0.68`,
    `happy-dom@^20.11.15 → ^20.12.0`, `pg-boss@^12.28.1 → ^12.29.0`,
    `layered-loader@^16.1.0 → ^16.1.1`. The whole `@ai-sdk` line and `ai` were named as
    age-blocked by the previous round and have now aged past the window. `layered-loader`
    16.1.1 is 23 hours old and would miss it, but the package is ours and sits on
    `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`, which is exactly the case that list exists for.
  - **Transitives the re-resolve moved**, 32 resolved entries added against 32 removed:
    `zod@4.5.2 → 4.5.4`, `@ai-sdk/gateway@4.0.68 → 4.0.69`,
    `@ai-sdk/provider-utils@5.0.33 → 5.0.34`, `qs@6.15.3 → 6.16.0`,
    `serialize-javascript@7.1.0 → 7.1.1`, `type-fest@5.8.0 → 5.9.0`, `ignore@7.0.6 → 7.0.7`,
    `electron-to-chromium@1.5.416 → 1.5.417`.
  
  The tree is structurally unchanged: 1434 distinct names and 1967 resolved entries on both
  sides, with no name added and none removed. The two-`zod` split the previous round introduced
  holds along the same seam: `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` keeps its hard-pinned `4.4.3` for
  its own config validation, and every app-reachable consumer (the AI SDK family,
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `drizzle-orm`) moves to `4.5.4` together, so a schema built in one
  module is still read by the same identity in another.
  
  **The agent CLIs**: Claude Code `2.1.251 → 2.1.252` and Codex `0.151.0 → 0.152.0`, both taken
  at their newest under the Dockerfile's standing exemption from the age window (2.1.252 is 17
  hours old, 0.152.0 is 8). That exemption covers exactly those three pins and is an explicit
  call re-made on each bump. Pi is already newest at `0.84.4`, as are both Pi extensions at
  `2.8.0`, and the extensions are held to the ordinary window regardless.
  
  The executor image tag rolls to `1.145.0` for the two CLI pins, because republishing over a
  live tag does not roll a deployment out. The deploy image is untouched at `0.6.1`: nothing
  under `backend/internal/deploy-harness/` moved.
  
  **Held back by the age window rather than by a compatibility call**, and takeable next round:
  `ai@7.0.87` with `@ai-sdk/openai@4.0.53` and `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock@5.0.69` beside it (all
  published late on 2026-08-31), `@aws-sdk/client-s3@3.1123.0`, `knip@6.34.0`, `undici@8.10.1`,
  and the OpenTelemetry line (`@opentelemetry/sdk-*` and `resources` at 2.11.0, the two OTLP
  exporters at 0.222.0).
  
  **Held by a deliberate call**, unchanged: `wrangler` stays at `4.124.0` and
  `@cloudflare/workers-types` at `5.20260815.1` for the sixth round running, because
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0` is still the newest pool and still pins that exact
  wrangler, and the types are derived from the `workerd@1.20260815.1` it brings. `4.127.1` is
  available and would split the runtime the tests prove from the runtime that ships. Drizzle
  stays at `1.0.0-rc.4`: still only per-commit `rc.5` snapshots. The frontend layer stays on
  `typescript@^6.0.3` while the rest of the tree is on `7.0.2`, which is why sherif ignores that
  name. The `node:26-trixie-slim` base digest and the `searxng` tag in the local compose stack
  are both already the newest published.
