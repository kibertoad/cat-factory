# @cat-factory/observability-otel

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d68e3a8: Add opt-in OpenTelemetry (OTLP) observability. A new `@cat-factory/observability-otel`
  package implements the kernel `LlmTraceSink` port and exports LLM generations (+ container
  tool spans) and metrics to any OTLP/HTTP backend — a workerd-safe fetch exporter on the
  Cloudflare Worker facade and the official `@opentelemetry/*` SDK exporter on Node, kept
  conformant by a shared mapping layer + a conformity test.

  - **kernel:** new `CompositeTraceSink` + `composeTraceSinks` so multiple external trace
    destinations (Langfuse and/or OTLP) fan out through the single sink slot.
  - **server:** new `OtelConfig` on `AppConfig`.
  - **worker / node-server:** wire the OTLP exporter (fetch on the Worker, SDK on Node)
    everywhere the Langfuse sink is wired, composed alongside Langfuse. Enabled with
    `OTEL_ENABLED=true` + `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` /
    `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` optional).
  - **cli:** advertise the `OTEL_*` vars in the generated `.env`.

  Refinements: the Node facade shares ONE trace-sink instance across the core, the container
  executor and the inline model-provider (so the SDK exporter's batch processors/timers aren't
  duplicated) and flushes + shuts it down on graceful shutdown (via `LlmTraceSink.shutdown` /
  `CompositeTraceSink` fan-out) so the final batch isn't dropped. Metric data points carry only
  the low-cardinality `gen_ai.*` dimensions — the unbounded workspace id stays on spans, off
  metrics — to keep metric-backend cardinality bounded.
