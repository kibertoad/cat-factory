### Patch Changes

- cd220f2: Add five catalog models, take the agent CLIs at their newest, and refresh the dependency tree.
  
  **Five new curated models.** Claude Fable 5.1, Gemini 3.8 Flash, a pinned Qwen3.8-Max-0902
  snapshot, and Meta's Muse Spark 1.3 in both of its commercial tiers. Every route was checked
  against the serving provider's live catalogue before it was declared, which is what decided three
  of the shapes:
  
  - **Claude Fable 5.1** is the first Claude entry carrying subscription, OpenRouter and Bedrock arms
    at once. Bedrock listed `anthropic.claude-fable-5-1` on Anthropic's own launch day rather than a
    generation behind, so the flavour is declared against a verified route. Its OpenRouter slug is
    DOTTED (`anthropic/claude-fable-5.1`) where the API id is dashed; the two genuinely disagree and
    normalising either spelling yields a dead id.
  - **Qwen3.8-Max-0902** is DashScope-only. OpenRouter serves the undated alias and publishes no dated
    slug, and a flavour declared before its route exists is picked by `effectiveVariant` and then
    fails at dispatch. It is a separate entry rather than a repoint of `qwen3.8-max` for the reason
    `claude-opus-4-8` is separate: a block pinned to a snapshot must keep getting that build.
  - **Muse Spark 1.3 ships as TWO entries**, standard and contributor. They are the same model on the
    same route and differ only in what Meta may do with the traffic: the contributor tier costs a
    twelfth on input in exchange for Meta training on the prompts and completions. That is a choice
    an operator has to make with the price in front of them, and one entry could only make it
    silently, so the two prices sit in separate rows and the SPA's "enable recommended" set omits the
    contributor slug.
  
  `meta` joins the OpenRouter vendor-prefix family map beside `meta-llama`, so an account that blocks
  the Meta family blocks Muse Spark too rather than leaving it unclassified.
  
  **The bare `bedrock` price row moved up a tier**, from ~$5/$30 to ~$10/$50 per 1M. A Bedrock ref
  carries the account's own geo prefix, so `priceFor` can only ever match the bare provider key, and
  that row is deliberately set to the frontier tier the catalog can select there. Fable 5.1 moved that
  ceiling; leaving the row behind would have metered every Fable-5.1-on-Bedrock run at half its cost.
  
  **Both runner image tags roll**: the executor to 1.150.0 for the CLI bumps, and the deploy image
  to 0.6.2 because the dependency round moved `@types/node` in its `package.json`, which the image
  builds from. A dep bump inside a harness IS an image-source change, and republishing over a live
  tag does not roll a deployment out.
  
  **Agent CLIs at their newest, ahead of the age window**, as the Dockerfile's standing note allows
  for exactly these pins: Claude Code 2.1.252 -> 2.1.260 and Codex 0.152.0 -> 0.153.2. Pi is already
  at its newest (0.84.4). Both Pi extensions move 2.8.0 -> 2.9.0 and have aged past the window, so
  they take the ordinary route.
  
  **Dependency refresh**: direct ranges plus a lockfile re-resolution, so transitives move to the
  newest release each declared range already admits under the `minimumReleaseAge` gate. 68 resolved
  names move and the re-resolve adds and drops nothing, leaving 1388 names on both sides. Direct:
  the `@ai-sdk/*` line (`amazon-bedrock@^5.0.73`, `anthropic@^4.0.49`, `openai@^4.0.57`,
  `openai-compatible@^3.0.43`, `provider@^4.0.10`), `ai@^7.0.91`, `@aws-sdk/client-s3@^3.1125.0`, the
  `@opentelemetry/*` set (`0.222.0` exporters, `2.11.0` SDK), `@types/node@^26.4.1`,
  `happy-dom@^20.13.2`, `knip@^6.34.0`, `oxfmt@^0.66.0`, `oxlint@^1.81.0`, `undici@^8.10.1`. The AI
  SDK family stays inside the `ai@^7` + `@ai-sdk/*@^4` majors that pair with `workers-ai-provider`.
  
  Three holds, each for a reason rather than for the age window:
  
  - **TypeScript stays at 6.0.3 on the frontend** while the backend is already on 7.0.2. TS 7 was
    tried and reverted: `vue-tsc@3.3.11` resolves `typescript/lib/tsc`, which TS 7 no longer exports,
    so the typecheck dies with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` before reading a single file. vue-tsc
    is the real gate for `.vue`, so the frontend moves when vue-tsc does.
  - **wrangler holds at 4.124.0 and `@cloudflare/workers-types` at 5.20260815.1** for the fifth round
    running. `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0` is still the newest pool and still pins wrangler
    exactly; the types version IS the workerd date that pin resolves.
  - **`@types/node@26.4.0` and `undici@8.10.0` keep a second resolved copy** beside the new ones, held
    by upstream ranges (`@types/pg`, `happy-dom`, `nuxt`, `unifont`) rather than by anything here.
  
  Also re-pins `openrouter:deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, the one row `check-openrouter-pins.mjs`
  reported as metering BELOW the live rate. The alias drifted up ~9% since the 2026-09-01 read, and a
  budget gate is allowed to be early but never short.
