## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 9f7ee39: Add "Requirements brainstorm" and "Architecture brainstorm" agents — structured-dialogue
  gates that PROPOSE options with explicit trade-offs and let a human converge on a direction,
  rather than doing all the work themselves or expecting the work done upfront.

  - One shared, stage-discriminated engine (`BrainstormService` over the existing
    `IterativeReviewService`), driven through the generic `ReviewGateController`. Two agent kinds
    (`requirements-brainstorm`, `architecture-brainstorm`) reuse it via a stage-bound repository
    adapter.
  - Persistence: a new `brainstorm_sessions` table keyed per (block, **stage**) — a block may hold
    a live requirements AND a live architecture session at once — mirrored across both runtimes
    (D1 + Drizzle/Postgres) with a cross-runtime conformance suite.
  - Handoffs (DB session state → next stage's prompt): `requirements-brainstorm` → the
    requirements review (its converged direction becomes the reviewed subject);
    `architecture-brainstorm` → the architect (surfaced additively as a prior output).
  - Pipelines: both steps are added to `pl_full` and `pl_fullstack` but **disabled by default**
    (opt-in per pipeline) — existing runs are unchanged.
  - Frontend: a shared brainstorm window (option cards with trade-offs → choose/steer/dismiss →
    incorporate → re-run), wired through the result-view seam, the workspace stream, and the
    palette catalog.

  Breaking: adds a new required table on both runtimes (`brainstorm_sessions` D1 migration +
  Drizzle migration) and a new optional `ExecutionEventPublisher.brainstormSessionChanged` event.
  No data migration — pre-1.0, stale state is acceptable.

  The brainstorm iteration cap reuses the merge preset's `maxRequirementIterations` /
  `maxRequirementConcernAllowed` knobs (no new preset field).

- 81b60d4: Add the future-looking **Follow-up companion** to the Coder agent.

  As the Coder works it now surfaces forward-looking items — genuine loose ends, useful
  side-tasks it is deliberately not acting on, and clarifying questions — by appending them
  to a `.cat-follow-ups.jsonl` sentinel file in its working directory. The executor-harness
  tails that file and streams the items **out** on the job view (drain-on-read, like tool
  spans), so a blinking **Follow-up companion** chip on the Coder step lights up the moment
  the first item appears — while the container is still running.

  A human triages each item at any point: file a follow-up as a tracker issue (GitHub Issues
  / Jira, via the existing `TicketTrackerProvider`), send it back to the Coder to address
  after delivering the key task, answer a question, or dismiss it. The pipeline's following
  steps do not start until **every** item is decided: an undecided follow-up or unanswered
  question parks the run at the Coder's completion (a new `followup_pending` notification).
  Once all are decided the engine loops the Coder for the queued / answered items (within a
  per-step budget) before advancing. The companion is enabled by default on Coder steps and
  disableable per step in the pipeline builder.

  This is pure engine + run-step state (no new table) so it is runtime-symmetric across the
  Cloudflare and Node facades — the cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the park →
  decide → loop → advance behaviour on both. Wire contracts (`followUpItem` /
  `followUpsStepState`, the `followup_pending` notification, the `follow-ups` result view),
  the `streamFollowUps` harness job flag + `RunnerJobView.followUps` channel (with an
  optional pool-manifest `followUpsPath`), and the `FOLLOW_UP_GUIDANCE` Coder prompt fragment
  are added across the stack.

  Bumps the executor-harness image (new src) — publish + redeploy to roll it out.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 4dd6e97: Fix: container agent (and repo-bootstrap) runs on **OpenRouter** and **LiteLLM** models
  were rejected at start with `'openrouter' is not supported` even though the LLM proxy
  already forwards both (their base URLs resolve in `resolveOpenAiCompatibleUpstream`). The
  proxyability guard hardcoded only `qwen`/`deepseek`/`moonshot`/`openai`/`workers-ai` and
  was duplicated (out of step) across `ContainerAgentExecutor` and `ContainerRepoBootstrapper`.
  Replaced both copies with a single shared `isProxyableProvider` in `@cat-factory/agents`,
  derived from `DEFAULT_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URLS` (so every OpenAI-compatible direct
  provider — including OpenRouter) plus the operator-hosted `litellm` gateway and the per-user
  local runners, so the start guard and the proxy can no longer disagree.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- ea59e91: Add the Kaizen agent: a post-run, continuous-improvement reviewer (toggleable per
  workspace, never a pipeline-builder step) that grades each completed agent step on how
  smooth/efficient vs confused/chaotic the interaction was and recommends prompt/model
  improvements.

  - After a run completes, the engine schedules a grading per completed agent step
    (skipping verified combos); a background sweep (Cloudflare cron / Node interval) runs
    the inline LLM grade. The grader's model is configured in Model Configuration like
    every other agent (the hidden-from-palette `kaizen` kind).
  - A `(promptVersion, agentKind, model)` combo that grades strongly (>=4) with no
    recommendations five times in a row is marked **verified** and is no longer graded.
  - New persisted tables `kaizen_gradings` + `kaizen_verified_combos` (D1 ⇄ Drizzle parity,
    asserted by a new cross-runtime conformance suite) and a per-workspace `kaizenEnabled`
    setting (a new `workspace_settings.kaizen_enabled` column).
  - New read API (`GET /workspaces/:ws/kaizen`, `GET /workspaces/:ws/executions/:id/kaizen`),
    a `kaizen` real-time event, a Kaizen screen (grading history + verified combos), and
    per-step grading status (scheduled/running/complete + results) inside the run window —
    never on the board.
  - A step with neither a provided-context snapshot nor any recorded LLM calls (e.g. prompt
    recording is off deployment-wide) is settled `failed` rather than graded blind, so a
    guessed grade can't advance a combo toward a bogus `verified`.
  - The Worker Kaizen sweep gains an in-isolate re-entrancy guard (mirroring the Node
    sweeper) so overlapping passes don't race the per-combo streak update.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 52d886a: Improve the ergonomics of authoring custom agent kinds and gates:

  - **Typed provider registry** (`defineProviderToken`/`wireProvider`/`requireProvider`, kernel),
    surfaced through `GateContext.getProvider`/`requireProvider`. A custom gate reaches its data
    source through the context instead of a hand-authored module global + unsafe `!`. The built-in
    `@cat-factory/gates` suite dogfoods it (public `wireX` signatures unchanged).
    **Breaking:** `GateContext` gains required `getProvider`/`requireProvider` (use `stubGateContext`).
  - **Schema-driven structured output** (`defineStructuredOutput`, agents): one valibot schema
    derives both the `agent.output` spec and a typed `parse`/`safeParse`, replacing the hand-written
    `shapeHint` string + lenient coercer. `registerAgentKind` auto-fills `agent.output` from a
    `structuredOutput` schema.
  - **Boot-time registration validation** (`validateRegistrations`/`validateRegistrationsOnce`,
    orchestration): a facade validates registered gates/kinds/pipelines at startup (gate `helperKind`
    resolves, `resultView` is known) and fails loudly instead of mid-run. Wired into both runtimes.
  - **Prompt + resultView wiring** (agents/contracts): `FINAL_ANSWER_IN_REPLY` + the read-only
    guardrail are applied to registered kinds from their `agent.surface` (fixing a registered
    `container-explore` kind missing the guardrail); `resultView` is now a typed picklist of
    `RESULT_VIEW_IDS` (unknown ids fail validation instead of silently falling back to prose).

### Minor Changes

- 6ff1f10: Link Confluence/Notion/GitHub documents as **living** best-practice fragments.

  A team can now link an external document (a Confluence page, a Notion page, or a
  GitHub file — any connected Document source) as a prompt-fragment whose guidance is
  **re-resolved from the source at the moment an agent run uses it**, rather than a
  one-time snapshot. Edit the upstream doc and the next agent run follows the new
  version — no re-import. The body is cached on the fragment as a last-resolved
  snapshot and refreshed on a short TTL (default 5 min); if the source is unreachable
  the run falls back to the cached body, so resolution never blocks a run. Available
  at both the account and workspace tiers; an account-tier link fetches through a
  chosen workspace's connection — recorded on the fragment so every consuming
  workspace re-resolves through that same connection at run time, not its own.

  New surface: `POST /:scope/document-fragments` (link a document as a fragment) and
  `POST /:scope/prompt-fragments/:id/refresh` (force an immediate re-resolve), a
  "Documents" tab in the fragment-library manager with a "Live · <source>" badge, and
  a `documentRef`/`resolvedAt` provenance block on `PromptFragment`.

  As part of this, run-time fragment-id resolution now goes through the merged tenant
  catalog (built-in ∪ account ∪ workspace) instead of only the built-in static pool,
  so **managed (DB-authored) fragments also reach a run** — previously only built-in
  ids resolved at run time. Behaviour is unchanged when the prompt-fragment library is
  not configured.

  Persistence: `prompt_fragments` gains `doc_source` / `doc_external_id` /
  `doc_via_workspace_id` / `resolved_at` columns on both runtimes (a D1 migration and
  a Drizzle migration); stale pre-existing rows simply carry nulls.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 04befe8: Business-only specs + an explicit `technical` task label.

  **Business-only spec-writer + "no new specs" outcome.** The spec-writer now captures
  ONLY business requirements. For a purely technical task (a refactor / non-functional /
  internal change with no externally-observable behaviour) "no new specs" is a valid
  outcome: the writer returns `{"noBusinessSpecs": true}`, the baseline spec is left
  untouched (`specPostOp` commits nothing), and the new `AgentRunResult.noBusinessSpecs`
  channel carries the determination. The spec-companion corroborates or disputes it via a
  new optional `technicalCorroborated` verdict on `companionAssessmentSchema` (a disputed
  "no specs" claim loops the writer back as before). The spec-writer prompts are updated
  accordingly (no version bump — they are not under prompt-version control).

  **Explicit `technical` label on a task.** Blocks gain an optional `technical` field
  (`true`/`false`/unset), persisted on both runtimes (D1 column ⇄ Drizzle column + generated
  migration; shared block mapper). A human sets it at creation (a "Technical task" checkbox)
  or via a tri-state inspector toggle (unset / technical / business). An explicit `false`
  (business) is forwarded to the spec-writer, which is then required to produce specs (it is
  told not to claim "no business specs"); `true` tells it the empty outcome is expected.
  Left unset, the engine infers the label from the settled spec phase — `noBusinessSpecs`
  (writer) combined with `technicalCorroborated` (companion) — both when the spec-companion
  converges automatically AND when a human proceeds past its iteration cap. Once a concrete
  label is recorded it is authoritative and not re-inferred (whether set by a human or a
  prior inference); a human re-opens it to inference by clearing it to "unset". When a task
  is technical the implementer treats the task definition / incorporated requirements as the
  primary source of truth and the committed specs as a regression-spotting reference; the
  `build` prompt is bumped to v3 and carries the per-task signal (only the implementer — not
  the architect/reviewer — acts on it).

  Breaking: none for existing data (the new columns default to "not determined").

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- be182e8: Hybrid linked-context delivery to agents, and deterministic reference resolution.

  Linked documents and tracker issues now reach a container agent as a cheap in-prompt
  summary index plus their full bodies materialised into a `.cat-context/` directory in the
  checkout (kept out of the agent's commits via a local git exclude), so the agent reads only
  what it needs on demand — replacing the previous 280-char document excerpt. Inline (no-
  checkout) agent kinds instead get the budgeted full body injected into the prompt.

  The engine also resolves references named explicitly in a block's description or its
  incorporated requirements (Jira keys like `PROJ-123`, fully-qualified GitHub `owner/repo#123`,
  and URLs) against the already-imported corpus, folding those high-confidence items into the
  context set. Each reference is resolved by a **point lookup** (a keyed `get`, or a new
  `getByUrl` repository method) rather than scanning the whole workspace corpus per step. Bare
  `#123` refs are intentionally not resolved: a workspace can hold many repos, so a bare number
  is ambiguous — name the issue as `owner/repo#123` (or by URL) to pull it in. There is no
  speculative relationship graph and no live fetching: everything is prepared backend-side,
  which is required because the container harness cannot reach Jira/Confluence/GitHub itself.

  Documents gain a `content_hash` column (D1 + Drizzle) so a re-import whose body AND title/url
  are unchanged is a no-op, preserving the existing projection and block link; a renamed/moved
  page still re-projects.

  Breaking (pre-1.0): `AgentRunContext.block.contextDocs` items now carry `summary` + `body`,
  `contextTasks` items carry `summary`, and `DocumentRecord` carries `contentHash`. The
  `DocumentRepository`/`TaskRepository` ports gain a `getByUrl` method (implemented on both the
  D1 and Drizzle stores). The executor-harness image gains an optional `contextFiles` job field;
  bump the runner image tag.

### Patch Changes

- c7b8012: Improve the requirements-review experience.

  **Auto-save answers (no button).** The requirements-review window no longer has a "Save
  answer" button: an answer is seeded into its textarea from the recorded reply and persisted
  on blur (and flushed before incorporate/proceed), so a value just needs to be typed.

  **"Recommend something" + the Requirement Writer.** A finding can now be marked for a
  grounded recommendation instead of being answered or dismissed. A new second companion of
  the requirements reviewer — the **Requirement Writer** (an inline LLM call, `WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
  `requirement-writer@v1`) — produces a suggested answer per finding, grounded in this
  precedence order: the block's **best-practice fragments** (team/org standards — checked
  FIRST; a match is flagged as the "current standard" and surfaced with a badge), then the
  in-repo `spec/` + `tech-spec/` (via the checkout-free `RepoFiles` port), then web search
  (provider-hosted on Anthropic/OpenAI models; gateway-RAG wiring lands separately).
  Recommendations are NOT AI-reviewed — the human accepts (it becomes the finding's answer,
  folded into the next incorporation), rejects, or re-requests with a "do it differently"
  note. Recommendations are a first-class collection on the review that survives the re-review
  item churn.

  - Contracts: `recommend_requested` item status, `RequirementRecommendation` +
    `recommendations[]` on `RequirementReview`, and the request schemas.
  - Persistence (both runtimes): a `recommendations` JSON column on `requirement_reviews`
    (new D1 migration `0009` ⇄ Drizzle column + generated migration).
  - Service: `RequirementReviewService.recommend` / `acceptRecommendation` /
    `rejectRecommendation` / `reRequestRecommendation`, with optional `resolveRunRepoContext`
    - best-practice-fragment resolver deps (degrade gracefully when unwired).
  - Controller: `POST /blocks/:blockId/requirement-review/recommend` and the
    `…/recommendations/:recId/{accept,reject,re-request}` routes.

  **Board progress for the review companions.** While the review is incorporating, re-reviewing
  or recommending, the board task card / mini-pipeline / inspector now show a spinning stage
  label (`Recommending…` added alongside the existing `Incorporating…` / `Re-reviewing…`).

### Patch Changes

- 7d1f829: Migrate the `tester` built-in agent onto the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness kind,
  continuing the Task-5 strangler (after the read-only kinds, the merger/on-call/fixers, the
  coder, blueprints, and spec-writer).

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now routes `tester` through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody` →
  `buildRegisteredAgentBody` as a read-only `mode: 'explore'` structured agent that clones the PR
  head branch (it makes NO commits) instead of the bespoke `/test` body. The agent returns ONLY
  its structured JSON report; `toRunResult` coerces that `custom` result into the `testReport`
  channel the engine's `TesterController` greenlights-or-loops the fixer on. The conservative
  coercion the harness `/test` handler used to apply — defaulting every field safely and honouring
  a greenlight ONLY when no blocking (high/critical) concern is open — now runs backend-side in
  `coerceTestReport` (and the engine re-applies it defensively). The role prompt and the
  run-mode / ephemeral-URL guidance come from the standard `roleSystemPrompt` + `userPromptFor`,
  which already carry them, so the harness adds none.

  The tester needs its docker-compose dependencies stood up for the run, so the generic
  `agent` explore flow grows an optional `infra` spec (`{ environment, noInfraDependencies?,
composePath?, environmentUrl? }`): `handleAgent`'s explore mode stands the local
  docker-compose infra up before the agent runs and tears it down afterward (lifted from the
  bespoke tester handler), folding a stand-up-failure note into the prompt so a missing Docker
  daemon is non-fatal. An `ephemeral` run manages no infra (the env is already deployed and its
  URL reaches the agent through its prompt). This is a harness `src/**` change, so the
  executor-harness image is bumped (1.13.0; deploy tag + `wrangler.toml`).

  Two regressions the migration introduced are fixed here. (1) The report's `environment` (which
  env the suite ran in, echoed to the UI) was authoritatively set from the task config by the old
  `/test` handler; the migrated `coerceTestReport` only read it from the model's JSON, so it was
  near-always dropped. The harness now stamps `environment` onto the structured result from the
  job's `infra` spec (the authoritative source), so it's deterministic again regardless of what the
  model emits. (2) A `local` service with no infra dependencies lost the precise "nothing was stood
  up — run the suite directly" guidance and was told its infra had been stood up on localhost;
  `testerEnvironmentSection` now restores the no-dependencies run-mode line for those services.

  The dead `/test` harness handler (and the other migrated kinds' handlers) is removed in the
  later harness-cleanup sweep. The cross-runtime conformance suite already covers the generic
  `agent` explore + structured-result path on both runtimes.

## 0.11.6

### Patch Changes

- 77b7d31: Migrate the `spec-writer` built-in agent onto the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness
  kind, continuing the Task-5 strangler (after the read-only kinds, the merger/on-call/fixers,
  the coder, and blueprints).

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now routes `spec-writer` through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody` →
  `buildRegisteredAgentBody` as a read-only `mode: 'explore'` structured agent that clones the
  per-block WORK branch (`cat-factory/<blockId>` — the coder's branch, created from base when
  absent; the spec-writer runs BEFORE the coder, so it seeds that branch) instead of the
  bespoke `/spec` body. The agent now READS the baseline spec from its own checkout under
  `spec/` (the harness no longer pre-injects it) and returns ONLY the complete spec doc as JSON;
  `toRunResult` coerces that `custom` result into the `spec` channel (via `coerceSpecDoc`) the
  engine already strict-validates + ingests. The `SPEC_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is updated to point
  the agent at `spec/overview.md` + the `spec/modules/**` shards, and a new `specWriterUserPrompt`
  carries the task increment + the read-the-baseline / reuse-the-taxonomy guidance the harness
  `buildUserPrompt`/`renderTaxonomyInventory` used to inject.

  The deterministic SHARD + commit of the in-repo `spec/` artifact that used to live in the
  executor-harness `/spec` handler now runs as a BACKEND built-in post-op (`specPostOp`,
  `@cat-factory/agents`), over the checkout-free `RepoFiles` port. It is keyed by the engine's
  own built-in op map in `ExecutionService` — deliberately NOT the agent-kind registry, so the
  built-ins never leak into `customAgentKinds` / the SPA palette. It reproduces the harness
  reconcile exactly: the canonical `service.json` / `overview.md` / `modules/<m>/<g>.{json,md}`
  shards are always rewritten and a removed module/group's shards are PRUNED (the deletion
  channel); the Gherkin `features/<m>/<g>.feature` files are SEEDED-ONCE (committed only when
  absent, never clobbering a polished one); and the pre-sharding monolithic artifacts
  (`spec/spec.json` / `rules.md` / `version.json`) + old flat `features/*.feature` files are
  dropped on sight. Idempotent: the spec has no `version.json` manifest, so the post-op
  byte-compares each rendered shard to the branch and makes NO commit when everything matches
  and there is nothing to seed or prune (durable-driver replay re-commits nothing).

  Because the spec doc is handed onward to be sharded + committed, the migrated kind opts into
  a new `output.failOnUnusableFinal` flag (kernel `AgentOutputSpec`) so the generic explore
  handler FAILS the run LOUDLY when the agent's final answer is cut off at the output ceiling
  (or empty) — restoring the bespoke `/spec` handler's `unusableFinalAnswerCause` gate, which
  the generic `handleAgent` path lacked, so a truncated reply can no longer be laundered into a
  half-baked spec by the structured repair. This is a harness change, so the executor-harness
  image is bumped to `1.12.0` (the `deploy/backend` `image:publish` tag + `wrangler.toml` are
  bumped to match). The dead `/spec` handler is removed in a later sweep step.

  Cross-runtime conformance asserts the post-op shards + commits the `spec/` artifact onto the
  work branch via `RepoFiles` on both runtimes.

  Also fixes a facade-parity gap in the self-hosted runner-pool result coercion
  (`HttpRunnerPoolProvider.coerceRunnerResult`): the generic `agent`-kind structured channel
  `custom` was missing from the pass-through allow-list, so a migrated kind's doc
  (blueprints / spec-writer / merger / on-call) was silently dropped on a runner-pool backend
  while the Cloudflare/local transports — which return the harness view verbatim — kept it.
  `custom` now passes through, and a regression test covers it.

### Patch Changes

- ce27690: Migrate the `blueprints` built-in agent onto the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness
  kind, and add a checkout-free file-DELETION channel the migration needs.

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now routes `blueprints` through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody` →
  `buildRegisteredAgentBody` as a read-only `mode: 'explore'` structured agent (cloning the PR
  branch when one is open, else the default branch — exactly its old `prBranch ?? baseBranch`
  clone) instead of the bespoke `/blueprint` body. The agent now returns ONLY the service →
  modules tree as JSON; `toRunResult` coerces that `custom` result into the `blueprintService`
  channel (via `coerceBlueprintService`) the engine already reconciles onto the board.

  The deterministic render + commit of the in-repo `blueprints/` artifact that used to live in
  the executor-harness `/blueprint` handler now runs as a BACKEND built-in post-op
  (`blueprintPostOp`, `@cat-factory/agents`), over the checkout-free `RepoFiles` port. It is
  keyed by the engine's own built-in op map in `ExecutionService` — deliberately NOT the
  agent-kind registry, so the built-ins never leak into `customAgentKinds` / the SPA palette.
  The post-op is idempotent (the `version.json` content hash short-circuits an unchanged tree,
  so a durable-driver replay re-commits nothing) and prunes a removed module's stale deep-dive
  file — the checkout-free analogue of the harness wiping `blueprints/` before writing.

  To support that prune, `commitFilesSchema` / `CommitFilesInput` (and the `RepoFiles` /
  `GitHubClient` `commitFiles` impl in `FetchGitHubClient`) gain an optional `deletions:
string[]`: paths removed in the same commit, built into the Git Data tree as `sha: null`
  entries against the base tree. Additive and non-breaking (absent ⇒ a pure add/update commit).

  The already-shipped executor-harness image serves this via its generic `handleAgent`
  explore-structured handler, so **no image bump is required**. One intentional, low-risk delta:
  the blueprint explore body now carries the shared web-tools fields like every other explore
  agent (gated by `webSearchProxyEnabled`), and the agent reads any existing blueprint from its
  own checkout rather than the harness pre-injecting the baseline tree into the prompt.

  The now-dead `/blueprint` harness handler is removed in a later step of the sweep (which
  bumps the executor image), once parity is confirmed on CI. The cross-runtime conformance
  suite gains an assertion that a `blueprints` step's post-op renders + commits the
  `blueprints/` artifact via `RepoFiles`, identically on both runtimes.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 22d7fff: Migrate the read-only built-in agents (`architect`, `analysis`, `bug-investigator`) onto
  the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness kind — the first step of the strangler that
  converts every built-in to the custom-agent model.

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now dispatches the read-only kinds through `buildRegisteredAgentBody`
  with a synthesized `container-explore` step, so they ride `kind: 'agent'` in `mode: 'explore'`
  (the SAME path a deployment's registered `container-explore` kind takes) instead of the
  bespoke `explore` dispatch kind. The job body is byte-identical to the old `/explore` body
  (same branch resolution, prompts and web-tools) bar the harness-internal temp-dir label, and
  the prose result maps to `output` exactly as before — a behaviour-preserving reroute, not a
  behaviour change. The already-shipped executor-harness image serves this via its generic
  `handleAgent` handler, so no image bump is required.

  The now-dead `/explore` harness handler (`handleExplore` / `parseExploreJob` / the `explore`
  dispatch kind) is removed in a follow-up once parity is confirmed on CI.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 128e12e: Custom agents: live pre/post-op execution + data-driven palette + generic result view.

  Registered custom agent kinds now run end to end. A kind's deterministic backend hooks
  fire around its agent step: `ExecutionService` runs its `preOps` before dispatch and its
  `postOps` after the result is recorded, over a per-run, checkout-free `RepoFiles` bound to
  the run's repo. The binding is a new optional engine dependency `resolveRunRepoContext`
  (`CoreDependencies` / `ExecutionServiceDependencies`), composed from a facade's wired
  `GitHubClient` + the executor's `resolveRepoTarget` via the new
  `makeResolveRunRepoContext` (`@cat-factory/server`) and wired symmetrically across ALL
  three facades (Worker `selectGitHubDeps`, Node `githubGateDeps`, local via
  `buildNodeContainer`). When GitHub isn't connected the hooks are skipped, so pipelines run
  unchanged without the feature. `runRepoOps` moved to `@cat-factory/agents` so the
  orchestration engine drives the hooks without importing the server HTTP layer. New kernel
  ports: `RunRepoContext` + `ResolveRunRepoContext`. The cross-runtime conformance suite
  asserts a registered kind's pre-op read + post-op commit on both D1 and Postgres.

  Frontend: the workspace snapshot now carries `customAgentKinds` (kind + presentation +
  container flag), which the SPA merges into its palette catalog
  (`useAgentsStore().registerCustomKinds`) so a registered kind is a first-class palette
  block + result view instead of the generic fallback. A `container-explore` structured
  kind's `result.custom` JSON is recorded on the step (new `PipelineStep.custom`) and
  rendered read-only by a new shared `generic-structured` result view — a custom agent gets
  a usable result window with no bespoke UI.

  The built-in agents are not yet migrated to this model (their rendering still lives in the
  executor-harness); that strangler conversion is sequenced as follow-up work. See
  `backend/docs/custom-agents.md` and the `@cat-factory/example-custom-agent` worked example.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e31cbc: Replace per-agent-kind model defaults with named **model presets**.

  A workspace now keeps a library of model presets instead of a single per-agent-kind
  default map. A preset is one `baseModelId` applied to every agent kind plus optional
  per-kind `overrides`, so "everything Kimi K2.7" is a base with no overrides. Two
  built-ins are seeded for every workspace: **Kimi K2.7** (the default — every agent runs
  on Kimi K2.7) and **GLM-5.2**. A task selects a preset via the new `Block.modelPresetId`
  (the inspector's "Model preset" picker + the new-task form); changing it affects only
  steps that haven't started yet. Resolution precedence is unchanged in spirit: a block's
  pinned model wins, else the task's selected/default preset's mapping for the kind, else
  the env routing.

  - `@cat-factory/contracts`: new `model-presets.ts` (`ModelPreset`, create/update schemas);
    `Block.modelPresetId`; `addTask`/`updateBlock` accept `modelPresetId`; the snapshot
    carries `modelPresets` instead of `modelDefaults`. The `model-defaults` contract is removed.
  - `@cat-factory/kernel`: new `ModelPresetRepository` port (replaces `ModelDefaultsRepository`),
    `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRESETS` seed + `modelForKindFromPreset` helper; `resolveWorkspaceModelDefault`
    resolvers gain an optional `modelPresetId` argument throughout.
  - `@cat-factory/orchestration`: `ModelPresetService` (CRUD + lazy seeding, replaces
    `ModelDefaultsService`) and `resolvePresetModelForKind`; the execution engine threads the
    block's preset into model resolution, the personal-credential gate and the start guard.
  - `@cat-factory/agents`: `StepModelInputs.modelPresetId` + the resolver signature.
  - `@cat-factory/server`: `ModelPresetController` (`GET|POST|PATCH|DELETE
/workspaces/:ws/model-presets`, replaces the model-defaults controller); the block mappers
    persist `model_preset_id`; the snapshot lists `modelPresets`.
  - `@cat-factory/worker` / `@cat-factory/node-server`: the `model_presets` table (D1 migration
    `0006` ⇄ Drizzle) + `blocks.model_preset_id`, replacing `workspace_model_defaults`.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0, no migration): the `workspace_model_defaults` table, the
  `/model-defaults` endpoint, and the snapshot's `modelDefaults` field are removed. Existing
  per-agent-kind default maps are dropped; workspaces fall back to the seeded built-in presets.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- d0081e1: Shard the in-repo `spec/` artifact by a module → feature taxonomy to kill merge churn.

  The spec-writer no longer commits a single monolithic `spec/spec.json` (+ `overview.md`
  / `rules.md` / `version.json`); every spec run rewrote those whole files, so two task
  branches that both touched the spec conflicted hard on merge. The spec is now SHARDED:
  a tiny `spec/service.json`, an `spec/overview.md` index, and one canonical
  `spec/modules/<module>/<group>.json` (+ a human `<group>.md`) per feature group, with
  the Gherkin `spec/features/<module>/<group>.feature` files nested to match. A group's
  file bytes depend only on that group, so concurrent branches editing different
  features never touch the same file.

  **Breaking (acceptable per pre-1.0 policy — no migration):**

  - `@cat-factory/contracts`: `SpecDoc` gains a two-level taxonomy — `modules: SpecModule[]`
    where each module holds `groups`, and each group carries BOTH its `requirements` and the
    domain `rules` scoped to it. The top-level `SpecDoc.groups`/`SpecDoc.rules`,
    the `SpecVersion`/`version.json` manifest, and the `SPEC_JSON_PATH`/`SPEC_RULES_PATH`/
    `SPEC_VERSION_PATH` path constants are removed; `SPEC_SERVICE_PATH`/`SPEC_MODULES_DIR`
    are added. `renderSpecForReview` walks the new shape. An existing repo's monolithic
    `spec.json` / `rules.md` / `version.json` (and any old flat `features/*.feature` files)
    are DELETED on the next spec run — the sharded layout is written fresh; no migration.
  - `@cat-factory/executor-harness`: sharded deterministic render + on-disk reassembly
    read-back + orphan-shard pruning (a removed/renamed module or group is deleted, not
    resurrected) + a one-time prune of the pre-sharding monolithic/flat artifacts;
    `version.json` dropped (no-op detection is now per-file via the commit).
    Content-derived (not positional) rule ids keep a group file byte-stable. The spec-writer
    prompt + reassembled-baseline now carry an EXISTING-taxonomy inventory and steer the
    agent to slot new requirements/rules into the closest existing module + feature (reusing
    exact names) rather than spawning near-duplicate domains/groups. Ships in the **1.9.0**
    runner image already pinned in `deploy/backend` (no further tag move needed).
  - `@cat-factory/agents`: the runtime-neutral `repo-ops/render.ts` mirror is reworked to
    the same sharded layout (`renderSpecVersionFile`/`nextSpecVersion`/`canonicalSpecJson`/
    `hashSpec` for the spec removed); `SPEC_AWARE_GUIDANCE` points readers at
    `spec/modules/<module>/<feature>.{md,json}`.
  - `@cat-factory/server`: `SPEC_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` describes the module → feature →
    {requirements, rules} structure, the no-catch-all rule, and the taxonomy-reuse rule.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- c70df09: Add the foundations for manifest-driven custom agents (pre/agent/post-op model).

  - `@cat-factory/agents`: new `repo-ops/render.ts` — the deterministic, container-free
    rendering + lenient coercion of the in-repo `blueprints/`/`spec/` artifacts
    (`renderBlueprintFiles`/`renderSpecFiles`/`renderSpecFeatureFiles`,
    `coerceBlueprintService`/`coerceSpecDoc`/`dedupeSpecIds`, the version manifests). This
    is the logic lifted out of the executor-harness image; the hash uses Web Crypto so it
    is runtime-neutral (so the hash + version helpers are async). The agent-kind registry
    (`AgentKindDefinition`) gains `agent` (execution surface), `preOps`/`postOps` (backend
    repo-op hooks) and `presentation` (frontend palette metadata), with matching accessors;
    `registeredKindRequiresContainer` now also derives from a container agent surface.
  - `@cat-factory/kernel`: new `RepoFiles`/`ResolveRepoFiles` ports (a per-run,
    checkout-free facade over the `GitHubClient` Git Data API) and the agent-definition
    vocabulary (`AgentSurface`/`AgentStepSpec`/`AgentCloneSpec`/`AgentOutputSpec`,
    `RepoOp`/`RepoOpContext`).
  - `@cat-factory/contracts`: new `AgentPresentation`/`AgentCategory`/`CustomAgentKind`
    wire shapes for the data-driven agent palette.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 6406c8c: Extract `@cat-factory/agents` — agent catalog, routing, prompts, fragment library, and versioned prompt registry are now a standalone package. `@cat-factory/core` re-exports the full public surface for backward compatibility. `REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT` moves from `requirements.logic` into agents (its natural home); `renderTaskContext`/`TaskContextView` move into `@cat-factory/kernel` (pure, kernel-deps-only).
- 8d11833: Companion agents + acceptance-test rework (the structured spec replaces the
  client-only scenario surface), plus a vocabulary split so "requirements" (the
  linked-prose context review) and "spec" (the structured in-repo document) are no
  longer the same word.

  - **Companion agents.** A companion grades a prior producer step's output, returns
    an overall quality rating (0..1), and — below the step's threshold (default 0.8) —
    loops the producer back for automatic rework BEFORE a human is asked, failing the
    run (`companion_rejected`) once the rework budget is spent. Companions declare an
    allow-list of target kinds and are placed as their own chain step in the pipeline
    builder (with a per-step `thresholds` array, parallel to `gates`). Built-ins:
    `architect-companion`, `spec-companion`, and `reviewer` reframed as the coder's
    companion. Wired into `ExecutionService` (`evaluateCompanion` + a unified rework
    revision path shared with the human "request changes" flow).
  - **Companion-gated requirements rework.** The per-block requirements review's
    rework step is now gated by a quality companion: below threshold the reworked doc
    is NOT accepted (the review stays `ready`), and the companion's challenge is
    surfaced in the review window and fed into the next rework. Persisted on
    `requirement_reviews.companion` (D1 migration 0036 + Drizzle).
  - **Acceptance tests via the spec.** The client-only scenarios store/UI is removed;
    the structured Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios live in the service spec
    (authored by the `spec-writer`, reviewed on its gated step) and are derived into
    Gherkin. The redundant `acceptance` polish agent is dropped; `playwright` still
    writes the runnable tests. `spec-writer`'s prompt now treats complete
    acceptance-scenario coverage as a first-class deliverable.
  - **`architect` is now a container agent** that explores the repo (read-only, like
    `analysis`) before proposing. Both read-only kinds share one reusable execution
    path: a new harness `/explore` endpoint (dispatch kind `explore`) clones the branch,
    runs the agent read-only and returns its prose report/proposal — making no commit,
    opening no PR, and (unlike `/run`) NOT treating an edit-free run as a failure. A
    shared read-only guardrail is appended to their system prompts.
  - **Companion rework correctness.** When a companion loops a producer back, EVERY step
    between the producer and the companion is now reset and re-run (clearing stale
    container job handles), so an intermediate container step re-dispatches fresh work
    instead of re-attaching to its evicted job. The automatic rework budget now counts
    only automatic attempts (`companion.attempts`); a human "request changes" on a
    companion's gate re-runs the producer without consuming it.
  - **Rename: requirements → spec** for the structured family. In-repo `requirements/`
    → `spec/` (`spec.json`, `spec/features/*.feature`; legacy `requirements/`
    relocated on first run); `RequirementsDoc` → `SpecDoc`; `requirements-writer` →
    `spec-writer`; the pipeline analyst `requirements` → `requirements-review`;
    `pl_requirements` → `pl_spec`. The context-review family (`RequirementReview*`,
    `requirement_reviews`) keeps the `requirements` name.

  The harness image changed (the `/requirements` endpoint + `requirements/` paths
  became `/spec` + `spec/`), so `@cat-factory/executor-harness` and the
  `deploy/backend` image tag are bumped to 1.0.6 and must be re-published + rolled out.

- 385bd93: Add an optional consensus-orchestration framework + a core Task Estimator.

  A new opt-in `@cat-factory/consensus` package lets an eligible agent step run through
  a multi-model **consensus** process — a specialist panel, a debate, or ranked
  voting/scoring — to produce a higher-quality result of the same shape the single-actor
  agent would have (a polished document, an aggregate of observations, an estimate). It
  integrates via the `AgentExecutor` seam: a `ConsensusAgentExecutor` wraps the standard
  composite and delegates to it when a step isn't consensus-enabled or gating marks the
  task ineligible. Eligibility is surfaced through a new group of assignable capability
  traits (`specialist-panel-capable` / `debate-capable` / `ranked-voting-capable`); the
  pipeline builder shows an "Enable Consensus" toggle (strategy, participants + models,
  optional risk/impact gating) on eligible steps. Each session persists a full transcript
  (`consensus_sessions`, both runtimes) rendered in a dedicated Consensus Session window
  and streamed live via a new `consensus` workspace event; every sub-call flows to
  `llm_call_metrics`. Wired per facade behind `CONSENSUS_ENABLED` (off ⇒ unchanged).

  A new **core** `task-estimator` agent rates a task's Complexity/Risk/Impact (0..1) after
  requirements are clarified; the engine persists it on `block.estimate` (new column on
  both stores) and the inspector shows the ratings. It gates the expensive consensus step
  and is useful standalone for triage.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0, no migration): `Block` gains `estimate`, the pipeline + pipeline-step
  shapes gain `consensus`, `AgentRunContext` gains `consensus` + `block.estimate`, and the
  `WorkspaceEvent` union + `ExecutionEventPublisher` gain a consensus variant. Stale rows /
  shapes simply re-create.

- e8005ba: Datadog post-release-health gate + Agent-On-Call.

  After a release ships, a new **`post-release-health`** polling gate watches the team's
  Datadog **monitors/SLOs** over a monitoring window. It reuses the existing gate machinery
  (`ci`/`conflicts`): a clean window advances with nothing spun up; a regression escalates —
  Datadog credentials stay on the backend and never enter containers.

  The gate is **opt-in**: it is NOT in any default pipeline. A user adds it deliberately in
  the pipeline builder, and it only appears in the palette — and is only accepted by the
  backend — once the workspace has an **observability integration connected** (today a
  Datadog connection). `PipelineService` rejects a `create`/`update` that adds an enabled
  `post-release-health` step otherwise.

  - **No blind revert.** On a regression the gate dispatches an **`on-call`** container agent
    that clones the base branch (the merged release; the work branch is deleted on merge),
    locates the merged commit and correlates its diff with the regression evidence (alerting
    monitors/SLOs + recent error logs), returning a JSON assessment (culprit confidence +
    `revert`/`hold`/`monitor` recommendation). It makes no commits and reverts nothing — the
    engine raises a **`release_regression`** notification for a human to decide. The gate only
    engages once the PR actually merged, attributes only post-release alerts (not pre-existing
    ones) to the release, and honours the full configured watch window even when it outlasts a
    single poll budget.
  - **Datadog connection + monitor/SLO mapping** are per-workspace (keys sealed at rest under
    a `cat-factory:datadog` cipher, write-only), managed in a new settings panel and the
    `GET|PUT|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/datadog/connection` + `/release-health-configs/:blockId`
    API. The gate maps a run's repo to its service-frame config (monitor + SLO ids + env tag).
  - **Merge-preset knobs**: `releaseWatchWindowMinutes` (default 30) and `releaseMaxAttempts`
    (default 1) bound the watch window + on-call dispatches.
  - **Incident enrichment (optional, additive):** PagerDuty / incident.io are NOT used to
    re-alert (they already page off the same monitors/SLOs) — instead the on-call
    investigation is posted onto an incident they already opened (annotate, never duplicate),
    behind a new `IncidentEnrichmentProvider` port. Slack + the in-app inbox carry the
    human-facing `release_regression` notification.
  - Runtime-symmetric: D1 (`datadog_connections`, `release_health_configs` + the two preset
    columns) ⇄ Drizzle/Postgres, wired in both the Cloudflare Worker and Node/local facades.
  - New harness route `POST /on-call`; the executor-harness image is bumped to `1.7.1`.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable):** `merge_threshold_presets` gains two columns — stale rows
  are re-seeded with the defaults.

- 3a12f15: Fix the container coding-agent role prompts that told the agent to push and manage
  the pull request itself — work it has no credentials for and was never meant to do.

  The `build`, runnable-tests (`playwright`) and docs (`business-documenter`) gates each
  instructed the agent to "open or update the pull request, push the fix, and wait for
  CI". Inside the run container the agent has no push token (version control is the
  platform's job), so a capable model would try `git push`, hit an auth wall, and then
  burn the entire run probing env vars, decoding tokens and poking at git remotes
  instead of doing the work (shipping zero changes and failing with "no file changes");
  weaker models just gave up.

  The three gates now share one `PLATFORM_DELIVERY_CONTRACT` (in `ci-gate.ts`) that makes
  the boundary explicit: the agent commits its OWN work (it alone knows which files are
  part of the solution vs scratch scripts/artifacts), validates locally, and stops; the
  platform pushes, opens the PR and drives CI (dispatching a CI-fixer on failure). It is
  told not to push, not to use `gh`/the GitHub API, and not to chase credentials, and to
  bound its effort rather than spin. The `build` prompt is bumped to `build@v2`.

  BREAKING: the `CI_RETRY_SANITY_CHECK` export is replaced by `PLATFORM_DELIVERY_CONTRACT`.

- b40da13: Simplify task granularity and run configuration; open the pipeline-step detail
  overlay from the zoomed-in board.

  - **Open the agent step-detail overlay from the board.** Clicking a pipeline agent
    in a zoomed-in task card now opens the full `AgentStepDetail` overlay (execution
    metadata + the agent's prose output), exactly like clicking it from the inspector
    or the focus-view pipeline — instead of expanding raw text inside the card.
  - **Removed the per-task auto-merge "confidence threshold".** The confidence-score
    auto-merge gate (`Block.confidenceThreshold`, the inspector + task-card UI, the
    `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` constant) is gone; the `merger` step's merge-policy
    preset (complexity/risk/impact ceilings) is the sole auto-merge gate. (The raw
    `confidence` score is still recorded for transparency.)
  - **Removed "feature" tracking from the board and the service map.** `Block.features`
    (the inspector's "Features implemented" tags and the board/module feature badges)
    is removed, and the in-repo blueprint / board-scan decomposition is now
    service → modules only — the Blueprinter, harness rendering, and reconciliation no
    longer produce a "feature" sub-level or derive tasks from it. Acceptance scenarios
    are now freeform per task (decoupled from features) pending a deeper
    requirements-driven model.
  - **Task creation picks a pipeline + merge policy; model selection removed.** The
    "Add a task" modal now offers a default pipeline (`Block.pipelineId`, which the
    task's Run/Start controls use) and a merge policy preset. The per-task model
    picker is gone — a model is resolved per step, not per task.

  Migration `0025_task_run_config.sql` drops the `confidence_threshold` and `features`
  columns and adds `pipeline_id`. Bumps `@cat-factory/executor-harness` (the blueprint
  rendering inside its image changed).

- 8eed38c: Introduce a generic, extensible AI provisioning facade so model resolution is no
  longer hardwired to the Cloudflare Worker.

  `@cat-factory/agents` now exposes `CompositeModelProvider` — a `ModelProvider`
  composed from one or more mixable `ProviderRegistry` maps — plus the base,
  runtime-neutral resolvers (`openAiResolver`, `anthropicResolver`,
  `openAiCompatibleResolver`, `cloudflareRestResolver`, `baseProviderRegistry`) and
  the shared OpenAI-compatible endpoint constants. Direct vendor usage works on any
  runtime; `cloudflareRestResolver` adds a non-binding path to Cloudflare-hosted
  models (Workers AI REST / AI Gateway) for non-Worker deployments.

  AWS Bedrock support ships as a separate opt-in package,
  `@cat-factory/provider-bedrock` (`bedrockResolver` / `bedrockRegistry`), so the
  AWS SDK is pulled in only by deployments that use it. It throws a clear
  `Unsupported Bedrock model` for any model id outside its configured allow-list.

  `@cat-factory/worker`'s `CloudflareModelProvider` is now a thin composition of the
  shared facade (behaviour unchanged: same providers, same "not configured" errors),
  and a new installation extension point — `registerModelRegistry` — lets a
  deployment mix extra provider registries (e.g. Bedrock) into every container build,
  including the durable Workflow and cron-sweeper paths.

- f49fa30: Give the inline design/research agents (architect, researcher) provider-hosted web
  search. The `AiAgentExecutor` now attaches the AI SDK's server-executed `web_search`
  tool (Anthropic / OpenAI) to its one-shot call for an allow-listed set of kinds, plus
  a per-kind usage nudge — so those agents can verify current libraries/APIs instead of
  relying on training data, the same way Claude Code and Codex do. Opt-in and a no-op by
  default: enabled per deployment via `INLINE_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED` (with
  `INLINE_WEB_SEARCH_KINDS` / `INLINE_WEB_SEARCH_MAX_USES` to tune the allow-list and
  cap), and only on providers that expose a hosted search — models on Workers AI / the
  OpenAI-compatible providers run unchanged. Both runtime facades wire it from env.

  The per-kind web-research nudge is data-driven, not a hardcoded switch:
  `AgentKindDefinition` gains an optional `webResearchHint`, so a proprietary/custom
  agent kind registered via `registerAgentKind` supplies its own nudge and the shared
  composer (`webResearchGuidanceFor`) picks it up — the shared surface never needs to
  know the custom kind exists. Built-in kinds carry sensible defaults; unknown kinds get
  a generic hint.

- 918764f: Add optional, opt-in **Langfuse** LLM observability. A new fetch-based
  `@cat-factory/observability-langfuse` package implements a runtime-neutral
  `LlmTraceSink` (new kernel port) against Langfuse's ingestion API — no Node SDK or
  OpenTelemetry, so it runs unchanged on BOTH the Cloudflare Worker (workerd) and Node
  facades.

  Proxied container-agent calls and inline (non-proxied) calls — requirements
  review/rework, document planner, fragment selector, the inline agent — flow through the
  SAME sink path: the orchestration `LlmObservabilityService` fans every recorded proxied
  call out as a generation, and an `InstrumentedModelProvider` wraps every resolved model
  so inline `generateText` calls surface the identical `LlmGenerationEvent`. Calls are
  grouped under one trace per run (`executionId`); inline single-shot calls become their
  own standalone trace.

  Off unless `LANGFUSE_ENABLED=true` and both keys are set; wired symmetrically in both
  runtime containers. Honours the existing `LLM_RECORD_PROMPTS` switch (prompt/response
  bodies are omitted from Langfuse too when disabled). The sink never throws into the LLM
  path — failures are swallowed and logged. The existing local metric store, spend gating
  and board rollups are unchanged; Langfuse is an additive external sink, not a
  replacement.

- 9be11e1: Add an automated merge-conflict resolver, and converge the container coding agents
  onto a shared base.

  **Conflict resolver.** Previously a PR that conflicted with its base degraded to a
  manual `merge_review` handoff. A new pre-merge `conflicts` gate now sits before the
  `ci`/`merger` steps in the standard pipelines (mirroring the CI gate): it reads the
  PR's mergeability (`PullRequestMergeabilityProvider` → GitHub `mergeable_state`) and,
  on a real conflict, dispatches a `conflict-resolver` container agent that clones the
  PR branch, merges the base in, has the agent resolve the conflicts, and pushes back
  onto the same branch — looping (bounded by the merge preset's attempt budget) until
  the PR is mergeable, or failing the run for a human if it can't. Pass-through when no
  mergeability provider is wired (e.g. tests / no GitHub), so existing behaviour is
  unchanged. The resolver never pushes a half-resolved tree (it guards on remaining
  unmerged paths).

  **Shared base.** The container agents were near-duplicates of one clone → write
  context → run Pi → push flow. They now share `runCodingAgent` (implement + ci-fix +
  conflict-resolve) on top of a thinner `withWorkspace` / `runAgentInWorkspace` base
  (also used by bootstrap / blueprint / merger), plus shared no-op-reason helpers — so
  fixes like the "judge the whole run, counting the agent's own commits" change apply
  everywhere instead of being re-derived per agent.

  Bumps `@cat-factory/executor-harness` (new `/resolve-conflicts` endpoint + shared-base
  refactor change its image).

- 5ec0d25: Real merge lifecycle: CI gate + CI-fixer, merger agent, and notifications.

  A task now becomes `done` only when its pull request is **actually merged** on
  GitHub — fixing the bug where a task showed "merged" (and a green board) from a
  confidence score alone, while CI was red and the PR still open.

  - **CI gate (`ci` step)** — auto-inserted before the merger in the standard
    pipelines. It polls the PR head's GitHub check runs and, on failure, dispatches a
    new **`ci-fixer`** container agent that pushes a fix to the PR branch, looping up
    to a configurable budget (default 10) until CI is green; polling stops the moment
    CI goes green. If the budget is spent it raises a `ci_failed` notification.
  - **Merger agent (`merger` step)** — runs last. A container agent scores the PR's
    complexity / risk / impact, and the engine compares those against the task's
    **merge threshold preset** to either auto-merge (a real GitHub merge) or raise a
    `merge_review` notification for a human. Presets are a per-workspace library
    (selectable per task); the CI-fixer attempt budget lives on the preset.
  - **`merger` is appended to the standard pipelines.** A pipeline with no merger now
    raises a `pipeline_complete` notification on completion (confirm + merge) instead
    of silently marking the task done.
  - **Notifications** — a new first-class, human-actionable board surface (inbox +
    events), modelled behind a `NotificationChannel` port so email/Slack delivery can
    be added later without touching the call sites. In-app delivery only for now.

  Adds migration `0024_merge_lifecycle.sql` (notifications + merge-preset tables, the
  `blocks.merge_preset_id` column). The executor-harness image gains `/ci-fix` and
  `/merge` endpoints (version bumped so the GHCR image is re-tagged).

- 7d5e060: Bridge the Cloudflare ⇄ Node/local runtime feature-parity gaps: seven product
  features that worked on the Worker but `503`'d on the Node + local facades (their
  repositories were never wired) now work identically on all three, each landed with
  a cross-runtime conformance assertion.

  - **Merge threshold presets** — `merge_threshold_presets` + `DrizzleMergePresetRepository`.
  - **Board-scan repository blueprints** — `repo_blueprints` + `DrizzleRepoBlueprintRepository`
    (the blueprint reads; the `blueprints` pipeline step already ran on Node).
  - **Document sources** — `document_connections`/`documents` + repos; the Confluence /
    Notion / GitHub-docs provider shells are promoted into `@cat-factory/integrations`
    so both facades compose the same providers.
  - **Ephemeral environments** — `environment_connections`/`environments` + repos;
    `HttpEnvironmentProvider` promoted into `@cat-factory/integrations`; a Node
    `setInterval` TTL-teardown sweeper mirrors the Worker's expiry cron.
  - **GitHub projections + inline sync** — `github_branches`/`github_pull_requests`/
    `github_issues`/`github_commits`/`github_check_runs` + `github_sync_cursors` and the
    full read/write projection repos, so the runtime-neutral `GitHubSyncService`'s inline
    webhook/backfill ingest persists on Node; `WebCryptoWebhookVerifier` promoted into
    `@cat-factory/server`.
  - **Repo bootstrap** — `reference_architectures` + bootstrap runs stored as
    `kind='bootstrap'` rows of `agent_runs`; `ContainerRepoBootstrapper` promoted into
    `@cat-factory/server`; a **pg-boss durable bootstrap driver** (the analogue of the
    Worker's `BootstrapWorkflow`) replaces the previous "bootstrap isn't durable on Node
    yet" gap, and the stale-run sweeper now re-drives orphaned bootstrap runs too. The
    self-hosted runner pool (`RunnerPoolTransport`) now accepts the `bootstrap` dispatch
    kind — the harness `/bootstrap` route needs no Cloudflare primitive, so a pool runner
    serves it just like the local Docker transport — so a real bootstrap run dispatches +
    pushes for real on Node, not just on local.
  - **Prompt-fragment library (ADR 0006)** — `prompt_fragments`/`fragment_sources` +
    `DrizzlePromptFragmentRepository`/`DrizzleFragmentSourceRepository`; the runtime-neutral
    `LlmFragmentSelector` promoted into `@cat-factory/agents`. Opt-in via
    `PROMPT_LIBRARY_ENABLED`/`PROMPT_LIBRARY_SELECTOR`, wired exactly like the Worker's
    `selectFragmentLibraryDeps` (repos + installation resolver + selector), so the managed
    tenant fragment catalog feeding every agent run works identically on all three.

  The Worker keeps the same behaviour (it gains the new conformance assertions and the
  shared promoted classes). **Breaking on Node/local:** these features now require their
  new tables — boot-time `migrate()` applies them; there is no data to preserve.

  The Node/local Drizzle migration lineage was re-baselined to a single fresh
  `drizzle-kit generate` migration off the current `schema.ts` (the prior hand-authored
  folders had no snapshots, which blocked `db:generate`); `db:generate`/`db:check` are
  green again. Safe because no deployed database depends on the old lineage.

  Deferred (still Worker-only, flagged for follow-up): real-time push (Node `realtime`
  gateway still `501`s — needs a WebSocket hub over Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`),
  queue-backed async GitHub ingest (Node ingests inline rather than via a pg-boss queue),
  and GitHub rate-limit telemetry (Node keeps the no-op repository).

- 4a08935: Add **OpenRouter** and **LiteLLM** as model providers. Both are OpenAI-compatible, so
  they reuse the existing inlined `openAiCompatibleResolver` path (no new dependency, no
  dedicated package) and work for both inline engine calls and container coding agents via
  the LLM proxy. Keys are onboarded per workspace/user through the UI key pool like the
  other direct vendors; their base URLs are deployment config — OpenRouter defaults to the
  public gateway (`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` override optional), while LiteLLM is operator-hosted
  so `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is required to enable it. Ships curated, direct-only catalog entries
  (OpenRouter: Claude Opus, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.5, DeepSeek, Llama 3.3; LiteLLM: a generic
  gateway-default entry) with approximate pricing/context, overridable via
  `SPEND_MODEL_PRICES`.

  Catalog selectability now also gates on a **resolvable base URL**: an OpenAI-compatible
  provider (everything but `openai`/`anthropic`) is only offered once its base URL resolves,
  so a LiteLLM model stays unselectable — and a pipeline using it is blocked at start —
  until `LITELLM_BASE_URL` is set, instead of passing the guard and throwing "No base URL
  configured" mid-run. Wired symmetrically into both facades' capability resolution.

  **Wire change:** `apiKeyProviderSchema` is widened with `'openrouter'` and `'litellm'`.

- 5c8ca33: Add per-step human approval gates to pipelines, plus two board polish fixes.

  A pipeline step can now be marked "require approval" when building the pipeline
  (`Pipeline.gates`, parallel to `agentKinds`; persisted via the new `gates` column,
  migration `0023`). When a gated step finishes, the run parks — reusing the durable
  decision wait — and a human reviews the step's proposal in an editable modal, then
  either **Approves** (the edited proposal advances and flows to downstream steps as
  context) or **Requests changes** (the same step re-runs with the human's feedback
  folded into the agent's prompt via `AgentRunContext.revision`). New endpoints
  `POST /executions/:id/steps/:approvalId/{approve,request-changes}`
  (`ExecutionService.approveStep` / `requestStepChanges`). The gate is surfaced on the
  board card, inspector, focus view and the zoomed-in pipeline.

  The **requirements reviewer** is now an automated, inline pipeline step
  (`requirements` agent kind) that runs before the architect instead of a manual
  inspector button. The default "Full build" pipeline seeds it first and gates both
  the requirements review and the architecture proposal.

  Also: the inspector panel now scrolls when its content exceeds the viewport, and
  zoomed-in pipeline steps are clickable to reveal the prose conclusion each agent
  produced (matching the inspector).

- 3a12f15: Add prompt caching for container-agent model calls, plus the observability to prove
  it works, and unify how both AI-call paths treat a provider's cache.

  - **Shared cache policy** (`@cat-factory/agents`): `providerCachePolicy` is the single
    source of truth for how each provider caches (`auto-prefix` for OpenAI/DeepSeek/Qwen,
    `explicit-anthropic`, or `none`). Both the in-container proxy path and the inline
    AI-SDK path consult it instead of hard-coding provider ids.
  - **Proxy** (`@cat-factory/server`): routes a run's calls to the same cached prefix via
    `prompt_cache_key` (keyed on the execution id) on providers that support it — the big
    win, since a container agent re-sends its whole growing prefix every turn. It also
    fixes the misleading `requestMaxTokens` metric to record the EFFECTIVE output ceiling
    (it previously logged the client's value before the Workers-AI floor override, so it
    read as `null`).
  - **Measure the hit rate**: `LlmCallMetric` gains `cachedPromptTokens` (read across the
    `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` / `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` field names), so the
    dashboard shows cached vs total prompt tokens per call. D1 migration `0028` + a Drizzle
    migration add the column.

  Note: the inline path's calls are single-shot (no growing prefix), so caching there is
  marginal; full inline-call observability (recording inline LLM calls through the same
  sink) is a follow-up.

- 37baa7f: Scheduled recurring pipelines on services.

  A service (a `frame` block) can now carry **recurring pipelines** that re-run a
  pipeline on a cadence — primarily **Dependency updates** and **Tech debt**. A
  schedule runs every `intervalHours`, optionally constrained to an allowed window
  (weekdays + an hour-of-day range, in a chosen IANA timezone), and owns one reused
  on-board task block inside the service that each fire runs the pipeline against
  (skipping any fire while a run is still in flight). Run history is kept ~1 week and
  surfaced in the inspector.

  - **Tech-debt pipeline** adds two agent kinds: a read-only `analysis` container
    agent that audits the repo, then a special non-LLM `tracker` step that files a
    **GitHub issue or Jira ticket** from the analysis before implementation. The
    tracker is a per-workspace selection (`GET|PUT /workspaces/:ws/tracker-settings`);
    `GitHubClient` gains `createIssue`. The runtime-neutral `TicketTrackerService`
    resolves each **tenant's own** connected integration (it is injected with a
    `fileGitHubIssue` filer + a `resolveJiraConnection` resolver, never shared/env
    credentials): on Cloudflare it files GitHub issues through the workspace's GitHub
    App installation against the service's repo, and Jira tickets (markdown→ADF) using
    the workspace's encrypted `task_connections`. Two new seed pipelines:
    `pl_dep_update`, `pl_tech_debt`.
  - **Per-tenant tracker on the Node facade**: both trackers now work on Node, each
    resolving the **workspace's own** integration. Jira: the task-source integration is
    wired on Node (always on; requires the shared `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) — a Drizzle
    `task_connections`/`tasks` store + the runtime-neutral Jira provider — so each tenant
    connects its own Jira through the existing UI (credentials encrypted at rest). GitHub:
    the filer mints a short-lived token from that workspace's own GitHub App installation
    (reusing the per-tenant App infra) and resolves the service's repo from the
    `github_repos` projection — no shared/env credentials.
  - **Persistence + scheduling are symmetric across runtimes**: D1 migration
    `0029_recurring_pipelines.sql` ⇄ Drizzle schema + generated migration; the
    Cloudflare `scheduled` cron fires due schedules (and prunes run history) ⇄ a Node
    `setInterval` sweeper does the same. New ports `PipelineScheduleRepository` /
    `TrackerSettingsRepository` with D1 + Drizzle implementations; the cross-runtime
    conformance suite covers schedule CRUD, `runDue`, and the tracker setting.
  - **UI**: an "Add recurring pipeline" button on the service frame (mirroring "Add
    task") opens a per-frame modal (pipeline + cadence editor; the tracker choice is
    surfaced inline for the tech-debt pipeline). The schedule's block shows a recurring
    badge on the board; selecting it reveals the cadence, run-now/pause, and run
    history in the inspector.

- c664fe6: Let deployments mix in custom agent kinds and predefined pipelines programmatically —
  the same installation-level extension pattern as opt-in model providers
  (`registerModelRegistry` / `@cat-factory/provider-bedrock`).

  `@cat-factory/agents` now exposes an agent-kind registry (`registerAgentKind` /
  `registerAgentKinds`, `AgentKindDefinition`): a registered kind contributes its system
  prompt (string or `(kind) => string`), an optional custom user prompt, and an optional
  `requiresContainer` flag. `systemPromptFor` / `userPromptFor` consult the registry for
  custom kinds — after the built-in tracks (so a registered kind never shadows a
  standard-phase, acceptance, mock or business-logic kind) and before the generic
  fallback. The Worker's `CompositeAgentExecutor` routes a registered
  `requiresContainer: true` kind to the container executor (inline kinds need no harness
  changes and work end-to-end).

  `@cat-factory/kernel` now exposes a pipeline registry (`registerPipeline` /
  `registerPipelines`): registered pipelines are merged into `seedPipelines()` by id
  (appended, or replacing a built-in in place), so every new workspace is seeded with the
  deployment's pipelines alongside the built-in catalog.

  Both runtime facades (`@cat-factory/worker`, `@cat-factory/node-server`) re-export
  `registerAgentKind` / `registerPipeline` (and the test-only `clear*` helpers) next to the
  existing model-provider seam, so a proprietary org package registers everything from one
  place at deployment-assembly startup. The agent-kind id was already an open string
  throughout (pipelines, steps, model defaults), so no schema change is required.

- 4026793: Requirements review: react to findings + a rework agent that feeds downstream steps.

  The requirements-review flow is now wired into the UI and reworks the requirements
  instead of overwriting the block description:

  - **New review window** (`RequirementsReviewWindow.vue`) modelled on the polished
    prose review window: a human reacts to the reviewer's structured findings —
    answering the relevant ones, dismissing the irrelevant — then runs the
    **requirements-rework** agent. Triggered from the inspector's "Review
    requirements" button (open-finding count badge). The old dormant
    `RequirementReviewModal` is removed.
  - **Rework, not overwrite.** `incorporate()` no longer rewrites
    `block.description`. It folds the answers into ONE standard-format requirements
    document (new versioned `REWORK_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: SHALL statements + MoSCoW +
    Given/When/Then acceptance + domain rules) stored on the review, and returns
    `{ review }`. It runs even with **zero findings**, so every task can carry a
    clean, writer-ready spec.
  - **Downstream consumption.** When a block has an incorporated review,
    `ExecutionService` feeds that reworked document to **every** agent step in place
    of the original description and drops the (already-folded-in) linked docs/tasks;
    the requirements-writer aggregates the reworked text per task instead of the raw
    description. The rework call rejects a length-truncated document instead of
    persisting a silently-incomplete spec.
  - **Both runtimes, enforced.** The requirements feature is wired on the Node facade
    too — a `requirement_reviews` Postgres table (Drizzle schema + migration) and
    `DrizzleRequirementReviewRepository`, plus the review/model deps in the Node
    container — so the review/rework API and the agent-context substitution behave
    identically on Cloudflare and Node. The cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the
    substitution against both stores so the parity can't silently drift.
  - **Frozen description.** Once a task's requirements are reworked, the inspector
    freezes its raw description (read-only, tucked behind an expander) and puts the
    standardized requirements in focus — the description is no longer what agents read.

- d65c979: Unify the approval gate into the conclusions reader, with GitHub-style review.

  The dedicated approval modal is gone. A pending gate now opens the same polished
  step-detail reader (ToC side nav, rendered markdown), in a new **approval mode**:
  the reviewer can comment on individual blocks of the agent's output (click a block —
  the rendered markdown carries `data-src-start/end` source ranges so the comment
  quotes that block's verbatim raw markdown), leave overall freeform feedback, then
  **Approve** (advance), **Request changes** or **Reject**.

  - **Request changes** re-runs the step with both the freeform feedback and the
    per-block comments folded into the agent's prompt (`AgentRunContext.revision`
    gains `comments`; `requestStepChangesSchema` now takes `feedback?` + `comments?`,
    requiring at least one).
  - **Reject** stops the run entirely — a terminal `rejected` failure
    (`agentFailureKindSchema`), so the board's shared failure banner + retry surfaces
    it (block → `blocked`). New `POST /executions/:id/steps/:approvalId/reject`
    (`ExecutionService.rejectStep`).
  - `stepApprovalSchema` gains the `rejected` status and a persisted `comments` array
    (`stepReviewCommentSchema`). No migration: approvals live in the execution
    `detail` JSON.

  - **Approve with corrections** opens an inline editor over the conclusions; the
    human's edits become the approved proposal carried forward (the existing
    `approveStep` proposal override — no backend change). Manual edits are a distinct
    mode and can't be combined with per-block comments / request-changes — they only
    happen _together with_ approving.

  The review surface is responsive — a right-side rail on wide screens, a bottom
  sheet below `lg` — so a pending gate is always actionable. Reject uses a two-step
  inline confirm (no native dialog). `requestStepChanges`/`rejectStep` reject a stale
  gate id whose step is already being re-run (`changes_requested`) so a double-submit
  can't dispatch duplicate work.

  Cross-runtime conformance gains assertions for reject and comment-driven re-runs.

- 8eed95b: Service-scoped best-practice prompt fragments, delivered by agent traits.

  A service (frame block) now owns an explicit selection of best-practice / guideline
  fragments — its programming standards — chosen from the **universal fragment pool**.
  That pool is the built-in catalog plus any fragments a deployment registers at startup
  via the new `registerPromptFragment` seam in `@cat-factory/prompt-fragments` (mirroring
  `registerAgentKind` / the model-provider registry); `GET /prompt-fragments` serves the
  merged pool. A workspace can also configure a **default set new services inherit**
  (`GET|PUT /workspaces/:ws/service-fragment-defaults`), seeded onto a frame's
  `serviceFragmentIds` when it is created (board drop, repo import, or bootstrap).

  Agents gain first-class **capability traits** (`@cat-factory/agents`): a registry of
  standard + custom traits with `traitsFor` / `hasTrait`, assignable to built-in kinds and
  to custom kinds via `AgentKindDefinition.traits`. Two standard traits ship:

  - **`code-aware`** (coder, ci-fixer, fixer, reviewer, architect): the running service's
    selected fragments are folded into the agent's system prompt, unioned with the block's
    own manual pins. Other kinds keep only their block pins.
  - **`spec-aware`** (every code-touching kind): the agent's system prompt gains guidance to
    read the in-repo `spec/` artifact (overview.md → rules.md → features/\*.feature →
    spec.json) and treat it as the source of truth for required behaviour.

  This **replaces the automatic per-run relevance selector**: fragment delivery is now
  explicit (the service's selection) and trait-gated (code-aware) rather than guessed per
  run. Per-block manual pins (`Block.fragmentIds`) still apply to that block's own agents.
  The tenant fragment **library** (account/workspace CRUD + repo sources) remains as a
  management surface but no longer feeds the run path.

  Persistence is mirrored on both runtimes: a `service_fragment_ids` column on `blocks`
  and a `workspace_fragment_defaults` table (Cloudflare D1 migration `0040` +
  `D1ServiceFragmentDefaultsRepository`; Node Drizzle schema/migration +
  `DrizzleServiceFragmentDefaultsRepository`), with the cross-runtime conformance suite
  asserting the workspace-default round-trip, new-service inheritance, and the
  code-aware-only folding on both facades. The UI adds a per-service "Service best
  practices" picker in the inspector and a "Default service best practices" workspace
  settings panel.

  BREAKING (Node facade dev/test only): the Drizzle migration lineage under
  `runtimes/node/drizzle/` was squashed into a single fresh baseline migration — the prior
  incremental migrations had a forked, non-commutative history (left by merging two
  branches) that broke `drizzle-kit generate`/`check`. There are no production Postgres
  deployments, so existing dev/test databases should be dropped and re-created from the
  new baseline rather than migrated. CI now runs `db:check` to keep the lineage honest.

- a54ada2: Spec-writer now applies ONE task's requirements as an increment, not a service-wide aggregate.

  The spec-writer used to receive `serviceTasks` — every task under the block's service
  frame, merged or not — and fold them all into one document. So a run for a single task
  ("add CRUD for office tables") produced a spec covering five unrelated sibling resources,
  and the spec-reviewer correctly read it as scope contamination. That violates the
  branched-work model: a task's baseline is what's already merged, plus its own increment;
  an unmerged sibling task does not exist for it.

  The spec-writer now reads the spec already committed on its work branch (the baseline)
  and applies ONLY the current task's clarified/reworked requirements as an increment —
  adding what the task introduces and adjusting existing requirements only where the task
  changes their behaviour. It translates the given requirements and does not invent or fill
  gaps (that is the requirements step's job). The in-repo `spec.json` stays the complete
  service spec; only the writer's editing scope narrows.

  - Engine: removed `gatherServiceTasks` and the `serviceTasks` field from
    `AgentRunContext`. The dispatch feeds the single task (the block, whose description is
    already the reworked requirements).
  - Reviewer: the `spec-companion` now judges fidelity to the requirements it was given and
    no longer penalises the writer for requirements it was never handed.
  - Harness (`SpecJob.tasks` → `SpecJob.task`): the prompt is reframed as "baseline plus
    this task's increment". Image retagged 1.6.0 → 1.7.0 (deploy/backend `image:publish` +
    wrangler.toml) so the new digest rolls out.

  Breaking: the `/spec` harness job shape changes (`tasks: []` → `task: {}`) and
  `AgentRunContext.serviceTasks` is gone. No migration — stale in-flight jobs simply break.

- 0090313: Surface a step's model the moment it starts, not only once its work finishes.

  A pipeline step's `model` was recorded on the step only after the work returned: a
  container step got its model from the job handle once `startJob` (which blocks for
  the whole cold-boot dispatch) returned, and an inline step from the result once the
  LLM query was over. But the model is fixed the instant its ref resolves (block pin >
  workspace per-kind default > env routing) — well before the container is up or the
  query runs — so the board showed "Spinning up container…" / a working step with no
  model for that whole window.

  The executor port gains an optional, side-effect-free `resolveModel(context)` that
  previews the `provider:model` without dispatching (implemented by the inline
  `AiAgentExecutor` and the `ContainerAgentExecutor`, forwarded by
  `CompositeAgentExecutor`). The execution engine calls it up front and sets
  `step.model` before the first "spinning up container" emit (container steps) and
  before the blocking LLM call (inline steps), so the model rides the same emit that
  shows the step starting. The job handle / result still re-assert the same value, and
  the preview is best-effort (an executor that can't preview, or a resolution failure,
  simply falls back to the old timing). No wire-contract change — the SPA already
  renders `step.model` whenever present, so it now appears immediately. A cross-runtime
  conformance assertion pins that `step.model` is set on the booting/querying emit.

- 7dc8e57: Link integration context at task creation, GitHub issues as a source, and feed
  all linked context to every agent step.

  - **Linked context now reaches every step.** Documents (Confluence / Notion / …)
    and tracker issues (Jira / GitHub) attached to a task were only rendered into the
    prompts of the generic agent kinds — the four standard phases (architect, coder,
    reviewer, tester) silently dropped them, so the agents doing the work never saw
    the linked requirements/issues. The engine already resolves this context per step
    (`ExecutionService.buildAgentContext`); a shared `linkedContextSection` is now
    appended to every kind's user prompt (`@cat-factory/agents`), standard phases
    included.
  - **Attach context when creating a task.** The "Add a task" modal now lets you
    select already-imported documents and issues and links them to the new task on
    creation (previously only possible from the inspector after the fact).
  - **GitHub Issues as a task source.** A new `github` task source reuses the
    workspace's installed GitHub App (no separate credentials): it resolves the
    installation that owns the issue's repo and fetches the issue body + comments via
    the existing `GitHubClient` (new `getIssue`). Refs accept a full issue URL or the
    `owner/repo#number` shorthand. Wired in when `TASK_SOURCES` includes `github` and
    the GitHub integration is enabled.

- cc8d96a: Flesh out the Tester agent, add an agent configuration-contribution mechanism, and
  make Mocker always precede Tester.

  - **Pipelines:** every built-in pipeline that runs a `tester` now runs `mocker`
    immediately before it, so the Tester has its external-dependency mocks up.
  - **Config contribution:** agents (built-in or custom, via the agent registry's new
    `configContributions`) declare task-level config parameters. The union over a
    task's pipeline appears on task creation + the inspector and freezes once the
    contributing agent's step starts. Values persist as a sparse `agentConfig` map on
    the block (keys/values length-capped); the catalog rides the workspace snapshot. The
    Tester contributes its `environment` (local vs ephemeral) and Playwright its e2e
    target (CI vs ephemeral). The old fixed `testTarget` block field is dropped — its
    column is dropped on both runtimes too (no backwards-compat shim).
  - **Tester → Fixer loop:** `tester` is now a container agent that runs the project's
    tests — standing infra up locally via the service's docker-compose (rootless
    Docker-in-Docker in the harness) or against an ephemeral environment — and returns
    a structured report (what was tested, outcomes, concerns, greenlight). On a
    withheld greenlight the engine loops a new dedicated `fixer` agent with the report
    and re-tests, up to the task's merge-preset attempt budget. Only **blocking
    (high/critical)** concerns withhold the greenlight — low/medium are advisory, so a
    trivial nit can't burn the whole fixer budget — and the engine re-applies that rule
    defensively over the report. When the budget is spent (or there's no PR branch to
    fix, or the report is unparseable) the run fails for real (the tester step is left
    un-`done`) and raises a human-actionable `test_failed` notification (retry action),
    mirroring the CI gate. New harness `/test` + `/fix-tests` endpoints; reports + fixer
    summaries render in the inspector and step detail.
  - **Service + provisioning config:** a service frame carries the Tester's
    docker-compose path / "no infra dependencies" toggle (a Tester pipeline can't start
    until one is set), plus a cloud provider and abstract instance size that resolve to
    the concrete instance-type id forwarded to the runner. Per-service sizing applies to
    the self-hosted-pool and local-Docker backends; the Cloudflare Container backend has
    a fixed per-class instance type (`wrangler.toml`) with no per-dispatch override, so
    it ignores the hints (pick `cloudflare` when you don't need per-service sizing).
  - **Account default cloud provider (fully wired):** accounts carry a
    `defaultCloudProvider` new services inherit — persisted on both runtimes, settable
    via `PATCH /accounts/:id` (owner-only) and the account menu, returned on the account
    wire, and pre-filled as the service editor's provider default.
  - **Local mode is 100% Docker/Podman:** a new first-class `docker` cloud provider
    represents the local daemon. The local runner backend sizes each per-job container
    from the abstract instance size (`--memory`/`--cpus`) and runs the Tester job
    `--privileged` so it stands its docker-compose infra up with Docker-in-Docker on the
    host daemon — never Cloudflare. A Tester-only pipeline with no PR branch now fails
    cleanly (no fixer to push to) instead of throwing.
  - Mirrored across both runtimes (D1 migration ⇄ Drizzle schema + migration).

- 48d2f0d: Add per-workspace, per-agent-kind default model selection. A workspace can choose
  which model each agent kind defaults to (e.g. point `architect` at a strong model
  and `tester` at a cheap one), overriding the env-driven `AGENT_routing` for that
  workspace at run time. New `GET|PUT /workspaces/:workspaceId/model-defaults`
  endpoints (returning/replacing `{ defaults: Record<agentKind, modelId> }`) and the
  selection surfaced on the workspace snapshot as `modelDefaults`. Persisted in
  `workspace_model_defaults` on both runtimes (D1 migration 0028 / a new Postgres
  migration).

  The defaults are applied uniformly through one shared resolver
  (`resolveStepModelRef` in `@cat-factory/agents`) used by **every** executor — the
  inline LLM executor, the container executor and the requirements reviewer, on both
  the Worker and the Node service — so a step's model resolves as block-pinned >
  workspace per-kind default > env routing for the kind > env default for every agent
  kind, not just the container kinds. A stale/unresolvable block pin now falls
  through to the workspace default instead of skipping it. Request keys (agent kinds)
  and values (model ids) are validated as trimmed, non-empty strings.

### Patch Changes

- 9d3a956: Clarity reviewer (bug-report triage) + bug investigator: a new bug-fix pipeline front.

  Adds two new agents at the front of a new `pl_bugfix` ("Triage & fix bug") pipeline preset:

  - **`bug-investigator`** — a read-only container agent (it runs the shared `/explore`
    harness path used by `architect`/`analysis`, so no new harness endpoint or image change).
    It clones the repo, reads the codebase from the raw bug report, and returns a prose
    enriched report plus an OPTIONAL working hypothesis — which it omits unless reasonably
    confident, so a low-confidence guess never misdirects the fix. Its output feeds the
    clarity reviewer (the triage subject) and the coder (a non-binding lead, via `priorOutputs`).
  - **`clarity-review`** — an inline engine gate step that triages the bug report for
    _fixability_ (repro steps, expected-vs-actual, environment, affected area), mirroring the
    requirements-review iterative loop (raise findings → answer/dismiss → incorporate into one
    standard-format clarified report → re-review until it converges, with the same per-task
    `maxRequirementIterations` / `maxRequirementConcernAllowed` knobs). The converged clarified
    report substitutes downstream as the task description for the spec-writer/coder (when both
    a requirements and a clarity review exist, the requirements doc wins).

  Persisted as a new `clarity_reviews` table on BOTH runtimes (D1 migration
  `0002_clarity_reviews` + Drizzle migration), wired in both facades' containers with a new
  `clarity` event on the real-time transport and a `clarity_review` notification type. A
  cross-runtime conformance assertion pins the clarified-brief substitution against both
  stores.

- 8065fed: Make the CI / conflicts gates observable. The gate window now shows the run id
  (copyable, with a jump into observability), a per-attempt history of every
  ci-fixer / conflict-resolver run (what each tried and how it ended), and — for
  the conflicts gate — the resolver's own account of which files it left
  conflicting (GitHub's API exposes mergeability as a single bit, so this comes
  from the resolver, plus a link to inspect the PR on GitHub). Failing CI checks
  now link straight to their GitHub run logs.

  Mechanically: `GateStepState` gains an append-only `attemptLog`; the engine
  records each gate-helper attempt when its job finishes (previously discarded the
  moment the gate re-probed) and sets the conflicts gate's `lastFailureSummary`
  from the resolver's output. `CiCheck` / `gateFailingCheckSchema` /
  `githubCheckRunSchema` carry the check run's `html_url` so the UI can link to it
  (populated on the live check-runs read; not persisted to the projection). The
  conflict-resolver result mapping now surfaces the still-conflicting file list
  (its `error`) instead of dropping it.

  Also tightens the conflict-resolver prompt: lockfiles (`package-lock.json`,
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, …) must be regenerated via the package
  manager rather than hand-merged — large generated files are what exhausted the
  resolver's context window and left big conflict sets unresolved.

- b48c455: Internal cleanup — no behavior or API changes. Deduplicates repeated helpers into
  shared modules: the subtask-snapshot comparison (`sameSubtasks`/`sameSubtaskItems`)
  used by the execution + bootstrap flows now lives in `@cat-factory/kernel`
  (`domain/subtasks.logic`), a `getErrorMessage` helper replaces the repeated
  `error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)` expression, the shared
  `STANDARDS_FOOTER` prompt line is centralized in `@cat-factory/agents`
  (`agents/prompt-shared`), and the identical document/task in-memory provider
  registries now extend a generic `MapSourceRegistry` exported from
  `@cat-factory/kernel`.
- 8eed38c: Author relative imports with explicit `.js` extensions across the shared backend
  packages so their emitted `dist` is directly resolvable by Node's ESM loader (no
  bundler required). This lets the Node runtime run the built output on plain Node
  (`node dist/main.js`) — no tsx, no esbuild bundle — and is inert for the Cloudflare
  Worker (wrangler bundles regardless). `handlebars/runtime` is imported as
  `handlebars/runtime.js` for the same reason (its type is sourced from the full
  package, type-only). No behaviour or public-API change.
- 197264e: Sharpen the `mocker` and `tester` agent prompts so they do real work instead of
  restating the implementer and resolving.

  - **Mocker.** Leads with the concrete goal — make the service runnable locally with
    just `docker-compose up`, every external SERVICE answered by a WireMock mock — and
    is now explicit that this is a hands-on build step: it must read the existing
    mappings, add/extend the stubs + fixtures + docker-compose wiring and COMMIT them.
    A prose-only "already covered" write-up with no committed mock files is called out
    as a failure of the step. The prose output is reframed as a summary of the mocks it
    committed (which services/operations are now mocked, and what was deliberately left
    unmocked).
  - **Tester.** Reframed as exploratory testing that actually runs the software:
    greenlights must be backed by observed runtime behaviour, not by reading the diff.
    It now starts from the earlier steps' artifacts — the `spec/` document and its
    Gherkin acceptance scenarios for the new functionality, and the WireMock mocks the
    mocker stood up on localhost via docker-compose — then probes edge/error cases and
    does a reasonable amount of regression testing of the blast radius. Sub-blocking
    issues go in `concerns` at low/medium severity without necessarily withholding the
    greenlight (the engine still skips the fixer when the report is greenlit).

  The existing tester gate already dispatches the `fixer` companion on a withheld
  greenlight and skips it when the tests pass — no wiring, pipeline or harness-image
  change for the prompts.

  **Frontend (`@cat-factory/app`).**

  - **Dedicated test-report window.** The `tester` archetype now declares a `resultView`,
    so opening a tester step opens a structured window (the universal result-view seam,
    like the requirements review) instead of the generic prose panel. It renders the
    report as a hierarchical tree — the scenarios the Tester exercised (its `tested`
    areas) → the per-area outcomes (passed / failed / skipped) → the concerns grouped
    under them — plus the greenlight verdict, outcome counts and the fixer-attempt state.
    The service spec is not yet exposed to the SPA, so spec-element linkage is derived
    from the report itself (a future spec endpoint can make it explicit).
  - **Companion visualization.** Companion steps (`reviewer` / `architect-companion` /
    `spec-companion` / `fixer`) are now visually tagged as companions in the pipeline
    views, and a gate step's conditionally-run companion — today the Tester's `fixer` —
    renders as a distinct sub-node marked **possible / running / completed / skipped**
    (in both `PipelineProgress` and the inspector's `TaskExecution`). `fixer` is added to
    the agent catalog + the `AgentKind` union.

- b80d657: Reorganize the `agents/` source into focused subfolders so each agent's prompt is
  easy to find. Pure internal refactor: the package's public barrel exports are
  unchanged, the precompiled template output is byte-identical, and behaviour is the
  same. The prompt TEXT now lives under `agents/prompts/*` (one file per track:
  `standard`, `acceptance`, `business-logic`, `mock`, `testing`, `companion`,
  `requirements`, plus the thin `roles` map extracted from the old `agent-catalog`,
  and the shared `shared`/`delivery-contract` constants); metadata ABOUT kinds lives
  under `agents/kinds/*` (`companions`, `traits`, `configs`, `read-only`, `registry`,
  `versions`); the model-call machinery lives under `agents/runtime/*` (`executor`,
  `routing`, `fragments`, `web-search`); and `agents/catalog.ts` is the dispatcher
  that maps a kind to its prompt. The versioned-prompt registry (`versions`) is split
  from the requirements prompt text (`prompts/requirements`) it references.
- 2dd7e56: Spec reviewer (`spec-companion`) now judges only what the Spec Writer controls.

  The reviewer kept faulting the writer for things the writer was never allowed to add:
  error paths, validation rules, and status codes the requirements never stated (or
  explicitly put out of scope), plus open questions like "is an extra field discarded?".
  That is reviewing the requirements, not the spec — exactly what the writer's mandate
  forbids it from filling.

  The prompt now: covers the happy path for every stated behaviour plus only the
  error/edge/boundary cases the requirements explicitly call for or that a stated
  requirement cannot be satisfied without; honours the requirements' own non-goals,
  assumptions, and exclusions instead of penalising the spec for leaving them out; and
  never asks the writer to "clarify" or "decide" a question the requirements left open.

- 86a5843: Require final-answer agents to emit the answer in the reply, not the reasoning channel.

  A spec-writer run, then a blueprinter run, on `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` failed
  with "the agent did not return a usable ...: its final turn produced no text (an empty
  completion)" even though the model produced a complete, valid document. The whole
  answer landed in the model's reasoning channel and the visible reply came back empty
  (telemetry: `finish_reason='stop'`, thousands of completion tokens, ~31k chars of
  `reasoning_text`, zero visible content). The harness reads the deliverable from the
  visible content only, so the no-empty-outcome gate (`unusableFinalAnswerCause`)
  correctly failed the run.

  This is universal to any agent whose deliverable IS its final reply. Added a shared
  `FINAL_ANSWER_IN_REPLY` fragment (`@cat-factory/agents`, `prompts/shared.ts`) that
  names the channel, and applied it to every final-answer agent: the four container
  constants in `ContainerAgentExecutor.ts` (spec-writer, blueprint, merger, on-call), the
  design/review/test standard phases, the tester report, the business-reviewer, the
  companions, the requirements reviewer + rework, and the generic report roles
  (researcher, analysis, bug-investigator, documenter, integrator, task-estimator,
  merger). It is deliberately NOT applied to side-effect agents whose product is a pushed
  commit (coder, ci-fixer, conflict-resolver, mocker, playwright, business-documenter):
  they legitimately end with no final text. The spec-writer prompt also now states it has
  no repository write access, removing the "maybe it just wants me to push the file"
  reading. Bumped the `requirement-review`, `requirement-rework`, and `review` versioned
  prompts. The no-empty-outcome gate stays as the safety net.

- 5ca8086: Add alternate subscription-backed coding harnesses (Claude Code / Codex) alongside
  the Pi proxy harness.

  - New per-workspace **subscription token pool** (`provider_subscription_tokens`,
    D1 + Postgres, encrypted at rest) with usage-aware rotation, behind a kernel
    port + `ProviderSubscriptionService`, wired into all three runtimes.
  - A guided **LLM Vendors** navbar UI to connect Claude / Codex / GLM (Z.ai) /
    Kimi (Moonshot) / DeepSeek subscription credentials (token pool, write-only).
    GLM / Kimi / DeepSeek all run via Claude Code against the vendor's
    Anthropic-compatible endpoint; the unfiltered credential list covers every vendor.
  - The executor-harness image now bundles the Claude Code and Codex CLIs; the
    harness selects `pi` / `claude-code` / `codex` per job from the model, and the
    subscription harnesses authenticate direct-to-vendor (no proxy) and report token
    usage from the CLI event stream for rotation + telemetry.
  - The model catalog becomes a canonical-model → provider map with precedence
    **subscription > direct > cloudflare** ("subscriptions always win"): latest
    Opus/Sonnet + GPT-5.5/5.4 (subscription-only), GLM-5.2/Kimi gain a Claude-Code
    subscription flavour, and `ModelOption` now carries per-flavour cost, context
    window, and a `quotaBased` flag (subscription usage is flat-rate quota, never
    billed against the spend budget).
  - A block's model is shared by all its pipeline steps, so a pin to a subscription-only
    model (Claude Code / Codex — container-only, no provider key) is degraded to the
    step's env-routing default for every INLINE LLM path through one shared seam
    (`inlineModelRef` / `resolveInlineModelRef`): both the inline agent executor and the
    requirements reviewer/rework, so the inline steps run instead of hard-failing and the
    two paths can't drift. The claude-code subscription harness repairs malformed
    structured output through the vendor's own Anthropic-compatible endpoint (the Pi
    harness still uses the proxy; Codex keeps the graceful no-repair path).
  - Hardening: the per-vendor token pool is capped to bound growth; the leased
    subscription credential is scrubbed from subscription-repair error details (not just
    GitHub-shaped secrets); and Codex token usage is read from its cumulative
    `total_token_usage` so multi-turn runs attribute usage correctly for rotation.

- 43f2443: Add a unified, persisted requirements structure stored in each service's GitHub
  repo. A new `requirements-writer` container agent runs before the coder in
  `pl_full` (and standalone via the new `pl_requirements` pipeline): it aggregates
  the clarified requirements of every task under the service frame into one
  PRESCRIPTIVE document, committed to the implementation branch
  (`cat-factory/<blockId>`, created from base when absent) so the spec is present
  before any code is written.

  The harness deterministically renders the document into `requirements/`: the
  canonical `requirements.json` (a `RequirementsDoc`), `overview.md`, `rules.md`
  (cross-cutting domain rules / invariants), a `version.json` staleness manifest,
  and Gherkin `features/*.feature` files (one `Scenario` per acceptance criterion).
  Gherkin is generated two-pass — mechanical render in the harness, then the
  `acceptance` agent polishes the `.feature` files and `playwright` turns each
  scenario into a runnable test. Every container agent reads the requirements via a
  new `REQUIREMENTS_GUIDANCE` block in its global `AGENTS.md`. The in-repo files are
  the source of truth; the engine strictly validates the returned doc
  (`parseRequirementsDoc`) at ingest. Mirrors the blueprint pattern; covered by the
  cross-runtime conformance suite.
