### Minor Changes

- 8728bf7: Capture per-run diagnostics on `agent_runs` for after-the-fact investigation. Each run now
  records a `diagnostics` object (riding in the run's `detail` JSON, like `notes`/`frontendBindings`)
  with the most recent container-step dispatch context — `agentKind`, resolved `model`, the `repo`
  (owner/name/baseBranch/provider), the **execution backend** (`local-native` vs `local-container`
  vs `runner-pool` vs `cloudflare-container` — the datum that distinguishes a native host-process run
  from a sandboxed container), and the control-plane host `platform`. The backend is reported by the
  runner transport (a new optional `RunnerTransport.backend` / `RunnerJobView.backend`, stamped by
  the shared job client; the native/container router stamps its per-job leg).

  Also preserves the harness's fine-grained failure `cause` (`git` / `api` / `no-usable-output` /
  `no-changes`) on the failure's machine-readable `reason` instead of collapsing it to the coarse
  `agent` kind — so a push/clone failure reads as `git`, not a generic agent error, without grepping
  the transcript. No schema migration (the diagnostics ride in the existing `detail` column; the
  cause rides on the existing `failure.reason`); mirrored across both runtimes with a cross-runtime
  conformance round-trip assertion.

### Patch Changes

- 2d97812: Initiative presets — slice 6 (docs-refresh pilot): deterministic documentation-layout
  autodetection.

  - **agents** (`presets/docs-refresh/docs-detect.logic.ts`): a new pure `detectDocsLayout(reader)`
    heuristic — the checkout-free repo probe behind the docs-refresh preset's form prefill (its
    `detect` hook lands in slice 8). Over a narrow `DocsRepoReader` (a `RepoFiles` satisfies it
    structurally) it proposes the preset's placement DEFAULTS without a clone: the docs root
    (`docs`/`doc`/`documentation`), the diagrams + business-rules subfolders (known dir-name
    heuristics under the detected root), a monorepo flag (workspace manifest / `package.json`
    `workspaces` / conventional `packages`|`apps`|`services`|`libs` dirs), a `per-service` vs `root`
    placement decision (sampled from whether most packages carry their own docs), and an
    `hasExistingMermaid` hint for the analyst.
  - Deterministic, memoized, bounded by a hard read budget, and TOTAL — it never throws and never
    rejects, so an unwired GitHub / a partial or unreadable repo simply yields the conventional
    defaults (a prefill must never block create). Detected values are non-binding FORM DEFAULTS; a
    user edit wins and the analyst confirms placement at planning time.
  - **kernel** (`shared/repo-scan.logic.ts`): extracts the checkout-free scan primitives the repo
    auto-detectors share — `joinRepoPath` + the budgeted, memoized `BudgetedRepoScanner` (over a
    `CheckoutFreeRepoReader`) — into one home, so a fix to path normalization / caching / budget
    lands once instead of drifting across copies.
  - **integrations**: the service-provisioning (`provision-detect`) and frontend-config
    (`frontend-detect`) detectors now consume the shared kernel primitive instead of their own
    private `joinPath` + `Scanner` copies — a behaviour-neutral refactor (the shared `exhausted`
    uses the precise "a read was actually skipped" semantics both had converged toward).

## 0.77.4

### Patch Changes

- 8f7af8e: Make ephemeral-environment provisioning DETECTION more universal — so it adapts to repos that
  follow different conventions than the stack-recipes pilot (different names, paths, tech stack). The
  changes are additive in the sense that detection can only ever surface MORE — it never removes or
  changes an existing detection, and a repo with no monorepo service-container dirs resolves exactly
  as before. Note the one behavioural change below: the env-template scan now also looks one level into
  `services/*`/`apps/*`/`packages/*`, so a monorepo that keeps per-service templates there will now
  surface them as low-confidence, user-confirmed `recipe.envFiles` where it previously surfaced none.

  - **Injectable detection conventions (deployment config).** A deployment can extend the built-in
    compose file names/dirs, seed dirs, and env-template dirs via the `ENVIRONMENTS_DETECTION_CONVENTIONS`
    JSON env var, threaded additively (built-ins always win; canonical compose names stay
    highest-priority) through `CoreDependencies.detectionConventions` into BOTH the service-provisioning
    detector (`EnvironmentConnectionService`) and the shared-stack detector (`SharedStackService`). New
    `parseDetectionConventions` + `EnvironmentsConfig.detectionConventions` (`@cat-factory/server`,
    parsed by both facades) and the exported `DetectionConventions` type (`@cat-factory/integrations`).
  - **Env-template detection now scans one level into monorepo service-container dirs** (`services/*`,
    `apps/*`, `packages/*`), so a per-service `*-dist`/`.example` template outside the compose dir (the
    pilot's documented `services/app/` gap) is surfaced — still bounded by the existing read budget.
    This is on by default (not gated behind conventions), so any monorepo with a compose file AND
    per-service templates newly gets those as `recipe.envFiles`; they are low-confidence and confirmed
    in the wizard before anything is materialized.
  - **The environment setup wizard elevates the "run deep analysis" nudge** when a repo ships its own
    imperative bring-up CLI/Makefile the deterministic scan can't read (`@cat-factory/app`), pointing the
    user at the LLM analyst — the intended universality mechanism for stack-specific imperative steps.

- 8f7af8e: Stack-recipes-and-shared-stacks slice 9 (pilot): add the sanitized pilot fixtures, golden
  detection tests, reference recipe/shared-stack configs, and the upstream-drift-alarm script
  (`pilot:golden`) under `@cat-factory/integrations`. No runtime `dist` change — this pins the
  deterministic provisioning detector's output against a faithful, sanitized snapshot of the
  initiative's acceptance repos and doubles as an upstream-drift alarm.

  Rename the pilot's placeholder consumer from `acme-main` to `acme-monolith` across the
  fixtures, goldens, reference configs, tests, and docs (and the drift script's live-clone env
  var `ACME_MAIN_DIR` → `ACME_MONOLITH_DIR`) for a clearer name; still fully sanitized, no
  upstream names.

## 0.77.0

### Minor Changes

- 802fc05: Deployer run-start config gate: when a pipeline includes an enabled `deployer` step, validate the service's ephemeral-environment provisioning (the in-repo "what/where") AND the workspace's infra handler (the "how") are complete + correct BEFORE starting, and — best-effort — probe the resolved deployment integration's live connection. A gap now fails loudly at start with an actionable, deep-linked toast (fix the service config / configure the handler / re-test the connection) instead of an async failed environment (or a silent docker-compose no-op) mid-run.

  - New pure decision logic (`decideDeployerConfig` / `deployerServiceConfigIssues` / `hasEnabledDeployerStep`) drives a new `ExecutionService` start guard shared by start/retry/restart.
  - New `EnvironmentProvisioningService.testProvisioning` probes the already-saved handler's connection; `canProvision` now honors the run initiator's local per-user handler overrides. The run initiator is threaded through every handler-resolution path — the new gate, the Tester infra gate, and the deployer's own dispatch decision — so a valid override-only local compose setup resolves identically at start and at provision time (a run that passes the gate provisions instead of silently no-opping).
  - New wire conflict reasons `deployer_service_provisioning_incomplete` and `deployer_connection_test_failed`; `provision_type_unhandled` toasts now carry a "Configure infrastructure" jump.

## 0.76.0

### Minor Changes

- 37d1517: Cache the checkout-free `RepoFiles` reads an agent's pre/post-ops run against a run's
  branch (caching-layer initiative, slice 4). A new `AppCaches.repoFiles` group cache serves
  the `getFile`/`listDirectory` idempotency byte-compares the `blueprints`/`spec-writer`
  post-ops issue every run and durable-driver replay, replacing a live GitHub contents-API
  round-trip per file. It is wired only on the `makeResolveRunRepoContext` (pre/post-op) path;
  the environments repo-validation and doc-quality reads stay live.

  - Grouped per `(installation, owner, repo, branch)` via the new kernel `repoFilesCacheGroup`
    helper and keyed per path (`f:`/`d:` prefixes), so one branch's reads drop together.
  - Self-verifying: each entry remembers the branch head sha it reflects, so an entry entering
    its refresh window re-validates with a single cheap `branchHeadSha` compare (bump on an
    unmoved branch, background reload otherwise) instead of re-fetching every file. A sha-pinned
    read is immutable (no probe). The head sha a cold batch stamps is read once per branch
    (memoised), so caching N files costs one extra head read, not N.
  - Coherence: the owning `commitFiles` self-invalidates the branch group after it commits, and
    the `push` webhook drops a branch it saw move out-of-band (an agent container's git push or a
    human PR-branch edit). Stays enabled on the Worker's isolate-safe profile (like the
    document-body cache, the head-sha probe re-validates without a cross-isolate bus) and in local
    mode (single-node, so `commitFiles` self-invalidation is already fully coherent).

## 0.75.0

### Minor Changes

- ecbcbec: Add repo autodetection to the shared-stacks definition screen. A new **Autodetect** button on
  the shared-stack form reads the repo at the entered clone URL — checkout-free, over the
  workspace's VCS connection (no clone, no host daemon) — and prefills the compose-shaped fields
  from a non-binding recommendation the user reviews before saving:

  - **`composeFiles`** — the base compose file plus any `<stem>.override.ya?ml` auto-merge family
    (the common single self-contained `docker-compose.yml` case resolves to just that one file).
  - **`managedNetworks`** — the `external: true` networks the compose references, which a shared
    stack is responsible for creating + owning (the `acme-net` shape). A self-contained stack that
    defines its dependencies internally declares no external network, so this stays empty.
  - **`composeProfiles`** — the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` the file declares.
  - A suggested **name** from the repo basename (only when the field is empty).

  New wire contract `POST /workspaces/:ws/shared-stacks/detect` (`detectSharedStackContract` +
  `sharedStackRecommendationSchema`), served by `SharedStackService.detect`, which reuses the
  deterministic compose scan (`detectSharedStack`) the environment provisioning detector already
  runs. Detection is a pass-through (`detected: false`) when no VCS connection is wired, and a
  genuine read fault surfaces as an actionable error. Nothing is persisted.

## 0.74.0

### Minor Changes

- fdba1ea: Shared stacks now declare their own preflight `prerequisites` (the slice-6 follow-up in the
  stack-recipes-and-shared-stacks initiative). A `SharedStack` carries a
  `prerequisites: PreflightRef[]` — the same machine-prerequisite vocabulary a consumer recipe
  declares — and `SharedStackService` re-runs those checks at the START of every bring-up
  (before clone / networks / `up`), streaming one provisioning-log step per check and failing fast
  with copy-paste remediation when a REQUIRED check is red (a non-required one is advisory). This
  closes the acme-shared-services M-rows (mkcert CA / hosts entries / ECR login) for the shared
  stack itself, not just per-PR consumer recipes.

  The probes are host-bound (local facade); a stack that declares `prerequisites` on a deployment
  with no host-probe runtime fails loudly rather than silently skipping a declared safety gate,
  mirroring the compose provider's `runPreflights` seam. Persistence is fully symmetric: a new
  `prerequisites` text-JSON column mirrored D1 (`0042_shared_stacks_prerequisites.sql`) ⇄ Drizzle,
  asserted by the cross-runtime shared-stack conformance round-trip. Pre-1.0, no data migration —
  existing rows default to `[]` (no prerequisites), unchanged behaviour.

## 0.73.6

### Patch Changes

- 6a701ef: Make a failed Kubernetes apiserver connection test actionable instead of dumping the raw
  `apiserver responded 401: {"kind":"Status",…}` body. A shared
  `apiServerConnectionFailureMessage` helper now maps the auth verdicts to a human message: a
  **401** is explained as an authentication failure (expired / no-longer-recognised token, NOT
  RBAC) with the two common local-cluster causes — a short-lived `kubectl create token` token
  (default 1 hour) that aged out, or a recreated/reinstalled cluster whose token-signing keys
  rotated and invalidated every earlier token — plus the fix (mint a fresh long-lived token and
  paste it in). A **403** is explained as an RBAC denial naming the attempted operation. Wired
  into both `testConnection`s (the `kubernetes` environment provider and the Kubernetes runner
  transport); any other status keeps the raw `status: body` shape.

## 0.73.5

### Patch Changes

- 10787c4: Make the "environment provisioning failed" surface actionable when no deploy runner is wired.

  - **Backend, provider-agnostic message:** the `EnvironmentProvisioningService` error for a
    render-needing config with no `deployJobClient` no longer hardcodes Kubernetes tooling (it
    reaches for any provider that needs a container-backed deploy). It names the runtime-neutral
    transport remedies (a self-hosted runner pool, `LOCAL_DEPLOY_RUNTIME`, or the Cloudflare
    `DeployContainer` binding) or using a config that provisions without a deploy container.
  - **Structured failure reason:** `AgentFailure` gains an optional machine-readable `reason`
    (JSON column — no migration), and this condition carries `deploy_runner_unwired`
    (`EnvironmentFailureReason` in contracts) from the thrown `ValidationError` through the
    deployer-step failure path onto the run's failure, so the SPA can act on the cause without
    string-matching prose. Adds `getErrorReason` to the kernel error helpers.
  - **Frontend, precisely-gated guidance:** the board's `AgentFailureCard` shows a "Configure…"
    deep-link on `environment`-kind failures whose destination follows the cause: a
    `deploy_runner_unwired` failure on a non-local deployment links to Infrastructure → **Agent
    containers** (`runner-pool`) — where the deploy runner/pool is actually wired, so the button no
    longer dead-ends on the Test-environments tab that can't fix it — while every other environment
    failure keeps linking to Infrastructure → **Test environments** (`environment`). The
    Kubernetes+local env-var hint (`LOCAL_DEPLOY_RUNTIME` + `LOCAL_DEPLOY_HARNESS_ENTRY` /
    `LOCAL_DEPLOY_IMAGE`) is shown ONLY for the `deploy_runner_unwired` reason, in local mode, and
    for a `kubernetes` provision — so a docker-compose / transient / future non-K8s failure never
    shows inaccurate guidance.

## 0.73.1

### Patch Changes

- 9cc02a0: Surface a real, actionable error when "auto-detect" (test-infra provisioning / frontend config)
  can't read the repository. Before, a genuine read fault (revoked App access, missing
  `Contents: read`, a rate limit, or a token-mint/transport error) was either masked as a
  misleading "nothing found" or escaped as an opaque 500, and the SPA discarded whatever the
  backend said and showed a fixed "Could not read the repository to detect provisioning." line.

  Now the checkout-free detectors record a genuine (non-404) reader throw and raise a
  `RepoReadError` when they detected nothing because of it; the environments service maps that to a
  `ValidationError` naming the repo and the underlying reason, with provider-aware guidance to check
  repository read access and rate limits (a GitHub-specific "Contents: read" hint only when the
  detect input pinned GitHub, a GitLab `read_repository` hint for GitLab, neutral otherwise — so a
  GitLab deployment isn't told to fix a GitHub-only permission). The inspector's Detect affordance
  surfaces the server's real message, and distinguishes the client-only "this frame's repo isn't in
  the connected repos" case with its own `inspector.detectRepoUnresolved` copy instead of the generic
  read-failure line.

## 0.73.0

### Minor Changes

- 1afa003: Make the **Deployer the single environment provisioner** and fix environment-lifecycle
  correctness so a `kubernetes`/`custom` service can no longer dead-end inside the Tester.

  - **Deployer in every tester/human-test built-in pipeline.** A type-aware `deployer` is seeded
    before the first tester / human-test / playwright step in the 12 relevant built-ins. It
    provisions `kubernetes`/`custom`, a `docker-compose` service with a resolvable compose handler,
    or an undeclared service on a workspace with a legacy connection, and is a fast **no-op** for
    `infraless`/frontend frames (and for `docker-compose` with no compose handler configured yet) — so
    the injection is safe everywhere. Touched built-ins get a `version` bump (reseed offer).
  - **Docker-compose provisions through the Deployer** (single-provisioner direction) whenever a
    compose handler resolves; the Tester then targets that provisioned env (`testerInfraSpec` already
    prefers a provisioned URL for any type). Until the shared-stacks compose-connection setup wizard
    lands, docker-compose with no handler stays a Deployer no-op and the Tester falls back to its
    in-container compose bring-up (no regression). See the initiative trackers for the full
    centralization owed once the wizard ships.
  - **`human-test` no longer self-provisions.** The gate READS the environment the upstream Deployer
    provisioned (the one env is shared by the AI tester + the human), and its recreate / fix-loop /
    pull-main rebuild now **loops back to the Deployer** to re-provision, rather than standing up its
    own env. No deployer before it (an infraless service) ⇒ the gate degrades to manual mode.
  - **Fail-fast run-start guard.** Starting a `kubernetes`/`custom` pipeline whose enabled chain
    reaches a tester/human-test with no enabled `deployer` before it is now refused with an actionable
    `deployer_required_before_tester` conflict (new `ConflictReason`) instead of the silent
    ephemeral-with-no-coordinates dead-end inside the Tester.
  - **Environment teardown correctness.** Superseding a provisioned env now tears the old infra down
    when the new provision targets a DIFFERENT provider identity (a config-change namespace switch, a
    provider/type change, or the `infraless` flip) — best-effort, with the TTL reaper as the backstop
    — instead of only tombstoning the registry row. Teardown + status now resolve the provider from
    the env RECORD's stored provision type/engine (the handler that stood it up), not the
    workspace-primary handler.
  - **Named-gate pipeline authoring.** Built-in pipelines are authored with `definePipeline` +
    named-step specs (`{ kind, gate, enabled }`) instead of fragile index-aligned `gates`/`enabled`
    boolean arrays, so a gate is declared on its step by name and inserting a step can't shift a flag
    onto the wrong one. The persisted wire shape is unchanged.
  - Frontend: a `deployer` palette/step metadata entry (renders as "Deployer" rather than a generic
    agent) and the localized `deployer_required_before_tester` conflict title.

  Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable): persisted built-in pipeline copies are offered a reseed to gain the
  deployer step; a `kubernetes`/`custom` pipeline that previously relied on the Tester dead-ending is
  now refused at launch until a Deployer is added or the service is set to docker-compose/infraless.

- eef8612: fix(runners): forward subscription-harness `callMetrics` through the runner-pool result mapper

  The Node self-hosted runner-pool transport (`HttpRunnerPoolProvider.coerceRunnerResult`)
  rebuilds a finished job's result from a fixed allow-list and never copied `callMetrics`, so
  a Claude Code / Codex run dispatched to a pool recorded zero rows in `llm_call_metrics` — the
  Cloudflare and local transports return the harness view verbatim and were unaffected. Coerce
  and forward `callMetrics` (validating each entry) so pool-backed subscription runs are
  observed identically, restoring runtime symmetry.

## 0.72.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f9d935: Stack recipes & shared stacks (slice 6): preflight prerequisite checks with guided remediation.

  A stack recipe can now declare machine `prerequisites: PreflightRef[]` — automated PROBE + human REMEDIATION checks for the inherently-manual one-time machine setup a complex compose repo needs (docker daemon reachable, free disk / RAM, container-registry login state, VPN reachability, mkcert CA, hosts-file entries, an env-file secrets marker). They are re-run at provision start: a failing REQUIRED check fails the provision fast with its copy-paste remediation in the provisioning log, instead of a mystery deep inside a 40-image pull (a non-required check is advisory — a warning). A `POST /workspaces/:ws/preflights/run` endpoint runs an arbitrary set of checks for the setup wizard's live re-check.

  - Contracts: `PreflightCheckId` / `PreflightParams` / `PreflightRef` / `PreflightResult` (`preflights.ts`) + `prerequisites` on `stackRecipeSchema`; the `runPreflightsContract` route.
  - Kernel: the runtime-bound `PreflightHostProbes` seam + `PreflightProbeOutcome`, and a `runPreflights` seam on `ProvisionEnvironmentRequest`.
  - Integrations: `PreflightService` (runtime-neutral orchestration over the probe seam) + provision-start enforcement in `ComposeEnvironmentProvider`.
  - Server: `PreflightController`.
  - Local facade: `createDockerPreflightProbes` (the host probes over the docker CLI + `node:*`), wired only where the compose runtime is (a Docker-family host daemon). The probes are runtime-bound (local facade only, the documented compose exception); the declaration + API are runtime-neutral and the recipe rides the existing `provisioning` blob, so there is no migration. On the Worker / plain Node the preflight API 503s and a recipe that declares prerequisites fails loudly at provision.

## 0.71.0

### Minor Changes

- dd6df12: feat(environments): attach per-PR compose stacks to their shared stacks (shared-stacks slice 5)

  Wire a stack recipe's `sharedStackRefs` + `externalNetworks` through to the per-PR consumer
  environment, so a complex compose repo can reach the long-lived shared infra it depends on (the
  acme `acme-net` shape). This is the provider-integration slice of the stack-recipes initiative.

  - **Provider-before-consumer bring-up.** `SharedStackService.ensureRefsUp(workspaceId, refs)`
    brings each referenced shared stack up (via the idempotent `ensureUp`) IN ORDER and returns the
    deduped union of the Docker networks they own — or a blocking `error` (never a throw) for a
    missing ref, a failed bring-up, or a deployment with no host daemon. It is exposed to the compose
    provider as the new `ProvisionEnvironmentRequest.ensureSharedStacks` seam (a kernel
    `SharedStackEnsureResult`), bound in `EnvironmentProvisioningService.buildProvisionRequest`.
  - **External-network attach.** `ComposeEnvironmentProvider.provisionRecipe` ensures the shared
    stacks up (streaming one `shared stacks (N)` provisioning-log step) and then attaches the per-PR
    project to `externalNetworks ∪ managedNetworks` via a new pure `attachExternalNetworks` folded
    into `prepareRecipeComposeFiles`: each network not already declared external across the merged
    `-f` layers is declared top-level `{ external: true }` and joined by every service (preserving
    the implicit `default` connectivity; skipping a `network_mode`-pinned service). The attach
    reasons about the MERGED stack (all `-f` layers together), not each layer in isolation, so it
    never re-adds `default` to a service the base intentionally scoped, never lands `networks` on a
    service whose `network_mode` sits in another layer (which compose rejects at `up`), and refuses —
    rather than silently overwrites — a requested network whose name collides with a project-owned
    network in the recipe.
  - Execution stays local-facade-bound (the documented compose runtime-binding exception); the recipe
    rides the existing persisted `provisioning` blob, so there is no migration. A recipe that
    references shared stacks on a deployment without the lifecycle wired fails loudly.

  long-lived compose stack a per-PR consumer environment attaches to over an external network
  (the acme-shared-services shape). Adds the `SharedStack` contract + `SharedStackRepository`
  port, the D1 ⇄ Drizzle `shared_stacks` table with a cross-runtime conformance round-trip, a
  `SharedStackService` lifecycle (CRUD everywhere + host-Docker `ensureUp`/`teardown` on the local
  facade, reusing the compose recipe-runner), the `GET|POST|PATCH|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/shared-stacks`
  (+ `ensure-up`/`teardown`) controller, and a "Shared stacks" panel in the Infrastructure window.
  Bringing a stack up is local-facade-bound (host daemon), the documented compose exception to
  runtime symmetry; persistence stays fully symmetric.

### Minor Changes

- 029a689: feat(environments): stack-recipe execution engine (shared-stacks initiative, slice 3)

  Teach the Docker Compose environment provider to run a declarative STACK RECIPE — the imperative
  bring-up of a complex multi-repo/multi-service stack (the acme-main pilot) expressed as data.
  The recipe is service-owned (`ServiceProvisioning.recipe`, landed slice 1) and now reaches the
  provider: `resolveProviderForType` folds it into the compose handler's `providerConfig.recipe` at
  provision time (the compose analogue of merging a kube `manifestSource`), so the provider keys
  purely on the persisted, merged config. Runtime-bound to the local facade (needs a host daemon) —
  the documented compose exception to runtime symmetry; the contracts + persistence stay symmetric.

  - **Multi-`-f` layering + profiles + env files** — `recipe.composeFiles` are read, `{{var}}`-
    rendered, host-escape-checked and port-neutralized per layer (concurrent per-PR stacks never
    collide), then written beside their originals in the checkout and passed as ordered `-f`s;
    `recipe.composeProfiles` drives `COMPOSE_PROFILES`; `recipe.envFiles` materialize committed
    templates into their gitignored targets before `up` (`.env.dev.local-dist` → `.env.dev.local`).
  - **Setup-step runner** — ordered `setupSteps` after `up -d` (no `--wait` — readiness is the
    recipe gate, since these stacks rarely declare healthchecks): `compose-exec` (composer install,
    migrations, cache warmup; seed import pipes a `.sql` dump via stdin), `copy-file`, `wait-http`,
    `wait-file` (container `test -f` or checkout), and the opt-in `host-command` (refused unless the
    workspace handler sets `allowHostCommands`). Each step has its own timeout budget.
  - **Terminal health gate** — `compose-healthy` (default, poll `ps`), `http`, or `compose-exec`
    (e.g. `bin/console monitor:health`), polled until it passes or its budget elapses.
  - **Per-step provisioning log** — the provider streams a `recordStep` entry per step (env file,
    `up`, each setup step, health gate) into the environment provisioning log, so the "View logs"
    drawer shows which step is running / died. Any step's failure tears the half-up stack down for a
    clean retry and surfaces the step's own error as the deployer step's `lastError`.

  New optional `ComposeRuntime` seams (implemented by the local docker-CLI runtime): `compose`
  stdin-streaming, `copyCheckoutFile`, `checkoutFileExists`, `hostCommand`. All compose safety lines
  carry over (host-escape guard on every recipe path, `include:`/cross-file `extends`/`privileged`
  refused). Fixture-driven unit tests cover the new pure helpers and the provider recipe flow
  (layering, env files, steps, stdin seed, HTTP gate, host-command opt-in, failure teardown).
  Recipe `teardownSteps` execution is deferred (the recipe schema carries them; `down -v` remains
  the teardown for now).

### Patch Changes

- 029a689: chore(environments): genericize the stack-recipes pilot name in code + fixtures

  Replace the real company name used as the stack-recipes pilot with the neutral `acme`
  placeholder across the code comments and detection test fixtures (`acme-main`, `acme-net`,
  `deployment/acme-db-dummy/*.sql`, …). Behaviour-neutral: the detection fixtures rename both
  the input and the expected assertion in lockstep, so the golden tests are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- f6399cf: feat(environments): stack-recipe detection (shared-stacks initiative, slice 2)

  Extend the deterministic, checkout-free provisioning detector (`provision-detect.logic.ts`) to
  recognize the STACK RECIPE a complex `docker-compose` repo implies (the acme-main pilot),
  populating the recommendation shape slice 1 added. Still non-binding — nothing is applied beyond
  the pre-selected base layers; the wizard (slice 7) confirms.

  - **Compose-file layering** — a bare `dev.yml` base is now recognized, and a base file's
    `<stem>.override.ya?ml` auto-merge sibling is layered into `recipe.composeFiles` while
    OS-specific overrides (`dev.wsl.override.yml`, `dev.mac.override.yml`) are surfaced as opt-in
    `composeFileCandidates` annotated with `os` (never auto-layered).
  - **External networks** — a top-level `networks:` entry flagged `external: true`
    (or `external: { name }`) → `recipe.externalNetworks` + a nudge to bind it to a shared stack
    (no `sharedStackRefs` fabricated — stacks arrive in slice 4).
  - **Env-file materialization** — committed `*-dist` / `*.example` / `*.dist` config templates
    beside the compose file / in the service's config dirs → `recipe.envFiles` template→target pairs
    (`.env.dev.local-dist` → `.env.dev.local`, `.split.yaml.dist` → `.split.yaml`); non-config
    templates like `README.dist` are ignored.
  - **Profiles** — the union of services' `profiles:` labels → default-off `profileCandidates`
    (opt-in groups; never written into `recipe.composeProfiles`).
  - **Seed dumps** — `*.sql` under seed-ish dirs (`deployment/`, `seed/`, …, one level deep) →
    low-confidence `seedDumpCandidates`, fullest-dump pre-selected, wizard-confirmed into a seed step.
  - **Repo-CLI hint** — a `bin/*console*` CLI / `Makefile` / `justfile` / `Taskfile` → the report-only
    `repoCliHint` (the nudge toward the slice-8 environment analyst). Detection never parses shell.

  The compose-doc semantics (`extractExternalNetworks`, `extractComposeProfiles`) live in
  `compose-environment.logic.ts` so the compose provider (slice 5) reuses the same predicates. When a
  repo is not recipe-shaped, the recommendation is byte-for-byte the simple single-file output as
  before. Fixture-driven unit tests cover each extension plus a combined acme-main-shaped repo.

### Minor Changes

- 773695b: feat(documents): workspace-linked template + exemplar documents per DocKind (doc-task WS1 items 2–4)

  A workspace can now point a document kind at its OWN template and example documents, reusing
  the existing documents integration end-to-end (no new fetch machinery). A single `role`
  (`template` | `exemplar`) + `docKind` tag on the projected `documents` row — sitting alongside
  the block-scoped `linkedBlockId` anchor — models both:

  - **Template** (singular per kind): its parsed section headings REPLACE the built-in skeleton
    for that kind. Resolved through one shared seam (`resolveDocTemplate`) that BOTH the
    doc-authoring prompts (via the engine-resolved `block.docTemplateBody`) and the `doc-quality`
    gate provider go through, so the writer and the gate never check against different sections.
  - **Exemplars** (multi-valued per kind): "good examples to emulate" surfaced to the author
    agents alongside a new set of built-in curated exemplars.

  The `documents` table gains nullable `role`/`doc_kind` columns (D1 migration ⇄ Drizzle schema +
  generated migration), with new `DocumentRepository` role methods mirrored across both stores and
  asserted by the cross-runtime conformance suite. The Node facade's Drizzle migration is the
  merge node that collapses the two pre-existing divergent snapshot leaves. New workspace-scoped
  routes (`GET`/`POST /document-role-links`, `POST /document-role-links/remove`) back a
  per-DocKind template/exemplar management panel in the Integrations hub (i18n in all 8 locales).

  Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable): the `documents` projection wire shape gains `role`/`docKind`
  fields; stale rows simply carry nulls.

### Minor Changes

- 48f9d97: Add opt-in AWS EKS runner + environment backends as a new standalone package
  `@cat-factory/eks`. An EKS cluster's apiserver is a standard Kubernetes apiserver, so the
  package reuses the native Kubernetes transport/provider from `@cat-factory/integrations`
  verbatim and only supplies the EKS differentiator: a short-lived SigV4-presigned STS (IAM)
  apiserver token, minted with WebCrypto (no runtime AWS SDK dependency).

  - `@cat-factory/contracts`: new first-class `{ kind: 'eks' }` runner + environment backend
    variants (`eksRunnerConfigSchema` / `eksProvisionConfigSchema`), the shared
    `eksClusterFieldsSchema` (`region` / `clusterName` / optional `stsHost`, now shape-validated),
    and the AWS secret-key constants. `'eks'` is now a reserved backend kind. `ProviderConfigField`
    gains `number` / `checkbox` / `textarea` field types, and `ProviderDescriptor` gains
    `configTemplate` / `values` so a native backend's typed config renders as a generic form.
  - `@cat-factory/integrations`: `KubernetesApiClient` gains an optional async token-provider
    seam (behaviour-preserving for the existing Kubernetes backend). `RunnerBackendProvider` gains
    an optional `form` descriptor (the shared apiserver fields live once in
    `kubernetesLogic.KUBERNETES_RUNNER_FORM_FIELDS`), so the Kubernetes/EKS runner backends
    self-describe their connect form.
  - `@cat-factory/node-server` + `@cat-factory/worker`: register the EKS backends by reference on
    BOTH facades (symmetric with the native `kubernetes` backend they extend; a pass-through until
    a workspace connects an `eks` backend). A real EKS cluster's private-CA apiserver is only
    reachable from a runtime that can pin a custom CA (Node/local) — the same constraint a
    private-CA `kubernetes` connection already carries, rejected up front at registration on the
    Worker rather than failing silently.
  - `@cat-factory/app`: the runner-pool connect form is now rendered generically from the backend
    descriptor for every backend kind (built-in `kubernetes`, opt-in `eks`, and custom native
    kinds) — the hardcoded `KubernetesRunnerForm.vue` was removed and the SPA no longer knows which
    optional backends exist. See `docs/initiatives/descriptor-driven-infra-forms.md` for the
    remaining env-axis + manifest-editor work.

### Minor Changes

- 49b498a: Bug-triage pipeline, Phase D — issue-intake foundations (ports + persistence).

  The plumbing the upcoming `bug-intake` step (Phase E) drives: a predicate search across the
  three task-source vendors, the per-schedule intake configuration, the "taken by cat-factory"
  pickup writeback, and the replace-link that keeps a recurring block's issue context from
  accumulating across fires. No engine step yet — this phase is ports, vendor implementations,
  and persistence only.

  - **`TaskSourceProvider.searchIssues` + `IssueIntakeQuery`** (kernel port): open issues on one
    vendor board matching every predicate (title fragment / labels / issue type), oldest-first,
    deduped against the already-worked exclusion list. Predicates are pushed into the vendor
    query wherever expressible — Jira compiles ONE JQL (`statusCategory != Done`, `issuetype`,
    `labels`, `summary ~`, `issuekey NOT IN`, `ORDER BY created ASC`; excluded ids validated
    against the key shape so a malformed id can't inject), GitHub compiles search qualifiers
    (`repo:` `is:open` `type:` `label:` `in:title`, the title fragment quoted as a literal phrase
    so it can't inject a qualifier) with the API's `created-asc` sort (a new `order` param on
    `GitHubClient.searchIssues`, honoured by the GitLab-backed client too) and filters the
    exclusion list case-insensitively from a bounded, paged overscan, Linear compiles a GraphQL
    `IssueFilter` (team, state type not completed/canceled, per-label `labels.some`,
    `title.containsIgnoreCase`) asked for oldest-created-first, also paged so a run of
    already-worked issues at the front can't starve the pickup.
  - **`PipelineSchedule.issueIntake`** (contracts + both runtimes, kept symmetric): the
    schedule-scoped intake config (`source`, per-vendor `board` scope, `predicates`, the GitHub
    `inProgressLabel`) as a new `pipeline_schedules.issue_intake` JSON column — D1 migration
    `0038_schedule_issue_intake.sql` ⇄ Drizzle schema + generated migration — parsed/serialized
    by shared `@cat-factory/server` mapper helpers so the column can't drift, accepted on
    schedule create/update (PATCH is tri-state: omitted = unchanged, null = clear), and pinned
    by a cross-runtime conformance round-trip. Requiring it when the pipeline carries a
    `bug-intake` step is Phase E's schedule validation.
  - **`IssueWritebackProvider.onIssuePickedUp`**: comments "Taken by cat-factory" (+ run link)
    on the block's linked issue(s) and marks them in-progress — Jira transitions into the
    `indeterminate` status category (`pickDoneTransition` generalized into
    `pickTransitionByCategory`), Linear transitions to the team's `started` state (the Linear
    state pickers generalized into `pickStateIdByType`), GitHub applies the schedule's
    `inProgressLabel` (default `in-progress`) via a new `GitHubClient.applyIssueLabel` that
    creates the label — with the required colour — when absent.
    Best-effort per issue like the existing hooks, and deliberately NOT gated on the workspace
    writeback settings — claiming the issue is intake semantics. Wired in both facades.
  - **`TaskLinkService.replaceForBlock`** + `TaskRepository.unlinkAllFromBlock`: detach every
    issue linked to the reused block in ONE batched write (D1 ⇄ Drizzle), then link the newly
    picked issue — so linked context never accumulates across recurring fires.

- 49b498a: Bug-triage pipeline, Phase E — the `bug-intake` engine step (engine + SPA).

  The recurring bug-triage pipeline's inbound entry point: each scheduled fire pulls ONE matching
  open issue from the schedule's configured tracker board, claims it, and seeds the reused block
  from it so every downstream step works that bug. Consumes the Phase D foundations
  (`searchIssues`, `issueIntake`, `onIssuePickedUp`, `replaceForBlock`); no harness change, no
  image bump.

  - **`bug-intake` engine step** — a non-LLM one-shot step (the inbound dual of `tracker`),
    registered as a `StepHandler` in the engine so it never reaches a container. It resolves the
    schedule's `issueIntake` config by block, searches the source (predicates pushed into the
    vendor query), dedupes against every already-worked issue in ONE batched projection read,
    picks the oldest match, imports + **replace-links** it onto the block, rewrites the block's
    title/description from it, and posts the best-effort "taken by cat-factory" pickup writeback.
    The read-and-claim logic lives in a new provider-neutral `BugIntakeService`
    (`@cat-factory/integrations`), wired into the engine only when task sources are configured.
  - **No-match no-op** — when nothing qualifies (or no task source is wired), the run completes
    SUCCESSFULLY with every remaining step marked `skipped` (there is nothing to fix) and no
    notification — the outcome is visible in the schedule's run history. A scoped early-complete
    that reuses the existing skip/finalize machinery, not a new gate archetype.
  - **Schedule validation** — `RecurringPipelineService.create`/`update` now require an
    `issueIntake` config, pointed at a connected task source, whenever the pipeline carries an
    enabled `bug-intake` step (validated at both boundaries, including clearing the config on an
    existing bug-intake schedule) — otherwise every fire would silently no-op.
  - **SPA** — `RecurringPipelineModal.vue` gains an issue-intake section (source picker from the
    connected task sources, per-vendor board field, and the title/labels/issue-type predicates)
    shown when the picked pipeline has a `bug-intake` step, with i18n across all locales.
  - **Conformance** — intake pickup (a matching issue is imported, linked and seeds the block),
    the no-match no-op (the run completes with the remaining steps skipped), and the
    missing-config rejection are asserted on every runtime against a fake task source.

  Review fixes folded in:

  - The no-match no-op now finalizes the reused block `done` DIRECTLY instead of via
    `finalizeBlock`, which for a mergerless bug-triage pipeline would have flipped the block
    `pr_ready` and raised a spurious `pipeline_complete` "confirm + merge the PR" notification for a
    PR that does not exist. The conformance no-match test now asserts the `done` status and that no
    notification is raised.
  - Schedule intake validation now checks `TaskConnectionService.isOffered` (available AND enabled)
    rather than `isEnabled`, which defaults ON for a never-connected source and so would have waved
    through intake from a source with no connection to search.
  - `PipelineService.update` now rejects enabling a `bug-intake` step on a pipeline whose attached
    schedules carry no `issueIntake` config (the pipeline-edit dual of the schedule-attach guard).
  - Reseeding the reused block on pickup also clears the previous fire's `peerPullRequests` so a new
    bug doesn't inherit a prior bug's connected-repo PRs.
  - `RecurringPipelineModal.vue`'s bug-intake detection now respects the per-step `enabled` mask,
    mirroring the backend, and the literal `owner/name` / `bug` / `in-progress` placeholder examples
    are inlined in the component rather than living (and being mistranslated) in the message catalog.

- 49b498a: Bug-triage pipeline, Phase F — structured, multi-repo investigation + clarification.

  The `bug-investigator` is upgraded from a thin prose role into a STRUCTURED, read-only,
  multi-repo `container-explore` kind whose triage drives the downstream `clarity-review` gate,
  and the gate learns to seed itself from that triage instead of running its own first LLM pass.
  Same kind id, so the existing `pl_bugfix` preset inherits the upgrade.

  - **Structured `bug-investigator`** (`@cat-factory/agents`): registered via the public
    `registerAgentKind` seam (the `security-auditor` shape) with a lenient valibot
    `bugInvestigation` schema — `clarity` (`clear` | `needs_clarification`), `summary`, ranked
    `rootCauseHypotheses`, `affectedRepos`, `suggestedReproductions`, and `questions`
    (non-empty only when clarification is needed). Its structured object lands on `step.custom`
    (rendered by the stock `generic-structured` view); a built-in post-completion resolver renders
    a prose digest onto `step.output` so downstream steps read the investigation via `priorOutputs`.
    The old prose ROLE entry is removed.
  - **Read-only multi-repo checkouts** (`@cat-factory/server` + `@cat-factory/executor-harness`,
    image bump): the multi-repo fan-out gate now also fires for `bug-investigator`, and the
    container-explore job body threads `peerRepos` + the multi-repo prompt section. The harness
    gains a read-only `runMultiRepoExplore` path — it clones the primary repo PLUS every connected
    involved-service repo as SIBLING checkouts, runs the agent once at the workspace root, and
    makes NO edits / commits / PR (a read-only peer carries no `newBranch`/`pr`) — so a
    cross-service bug is traced across every repo it touches. `PeerRepoSpec.newBranch` is now
    optional (present for the coding fan-out, absent for the read-only one).
  - **Clarity gate seeding + auto-pass** (`@cat-factory/orchestration`): when a structured
    investigator ran upstream, the `clarity-review` gate seeds DETERMINISTICALLY from its triage —
    no reviewer LLM — auto-passing on `clarity === 'clear'` (advance, no human park, no
    notification) and seeding one blocking finding per `question` on `needs_clarification` (park
    for a human, exactly as an LLM reviewer pass would). Because the seed needs no model, the gate
    now activates whenever the clarity store is wired, and the review/incorporate/re-review LLM
    paths degrade gracefully when unwired. Mirrors the requirements-review auto-pass pattern.
  - **Tracker echo on park** (`@cat-factory/kernel` port + `@cat-factory/integrations`): a new
    best-effort `IssueWritebackProvider.postQuestions` echoes the open questions as a comment on
    the block's linked tracker issue when the gate parks — answers still arrive in-app (the tracker
    comment is an echo, not a channel). Not gated on the workspace writeback settings, and a
    tracker outage never fails the run.
  - **Conformance**: a two-facade suite drives the investigator → clarity gate flow — `clear`
    auto-passes straight through to the next step with the digest recorded, and
    `needs_clarification` parks one finding per question then resumes on dismiss-all + proceed.

  The runner image is bumped for the read-only multi-repo explore path; the three hand-maintained
  image-tag pins are synced.

- 49b498a: Service connections Phase 3 — multi-repo coding. The implementer now fans a cross-service
  change out across every connected involved-service repo, not just the task's own. A new
  `resolveRepoTargets` resolves the task's own repo PLUS each involved service's repo, deduped
  by repo (two services in one monorepo collapse into a single checkout with both
  subdirectories noted; a service co-located in the primary's own repo rides the own-service
  PR). `ContainerAgentExecutor` builds a `peerRepos` job body + a "Multi-repo workspace" prompt
  section for the `coder` kind and works at the repo root so it can reach every involved
  subtree. The executor-harness clones each peer repo as a SIBLING checkout under one workspace
  root, runs the agent once across all of them, and opens one PR per repo it actually changed.
  The own-service PR stays on `block.pullRequest`; the peer PRs are recorded on the new
  `block.peerPullRequests` (`AgentRunResult.peerPullRequests` → engine → JSON column, mirrored
  on D1 + Drizzle), with an `allPullRequests(block)` helper for the multi-repo-aware readers.
  Peer clone URLs are host-allowlisted exactly like the primary. Bumps the runner image
  (`peerRepos` job field + sibling-checkout flow).

### Minor Changes

- 1f6d9fc: Cache the workspace GitHub repo projection through the app caching seam
  (caching-layer initiative, slice 3). A new `AppCaches.repoProjection` group cache
  (grouped and keyed by workspace id) serves the whole-projection re-list that the
  block→repo resolver (`buildResolveRepoTarget`) runs on every agent dispatch and
  every durable poll tick, replacing a live `repoProjectionRepository.list` per
  resolution with a per-workspace cached read.

  Coherence is invalidation-driven: every projection write drops the workspace
  group after it commits — `GitHubSyncService` (repo link / monorepo-flag / the
  exact-set write + tombstone / the link-time full re-stamp, fanned out per
  workspace), `BoardService.addServiceFromRepo` (the monorepo-flag write on the
  import-existing-repo path), `WebhookService` (the `installation_repositories`
  removed tombstone), and `ContainerRepoBootstrapper` (projecting a freshly
  bootstrapped repo). `GitHubSyncService.syncRepo` only invalidates on a `full`
  (link-time) pass — an incremental resync re-stamps `syncedAt` alone, which the
  resolver never reads, so invalidating there would only churn the cache. The
  installation lookup and the tree-depth-bounded block ancestry walk stay live, so
  a block reparent or a service repo-link change needs no cache invalidation.

  The cache is pass-through on the Cloudflare Worker's isolate-safe profile (our own
  mutable D1 state, no cross-isolate invalidation bus), so the Worker reads the
  projection live. Local mode is likewise pass-through: it seeds the projection via
  the out-of-process `link-repo` CLI and runs single-node with no invalidation bus,
  so an in-memory TTL'd entry could serve a pre-link projection. So the cache is
  active on the multi-node-capable Node facade only. Absent a cache (tests /
  harnesses) every resolve lists live, unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- e5ddaa4: Cache document-backed prompt-fragment bodies through the app caching seam
  (caching-layer initiative, slice 2). A new `AppCaches.fragmentDocumentBody`
  group cache serves a living fragment's external Confluence/Notion/GitHub/Figma/
  Zeplin/Linear body, replacing the hand-rolled `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_FRAGMENT_TTL_MS`
  in `FragmentLibraryService`: a run reads the cached body instead of blocking on a
  live page fetch, and an entry entering its refresh window runs the source's cheap
  version probe — keeping the cached body when the page hasn't moved, reloading in
  the background when it has.

  To support the probe, `DocumentContent` now carries an opaque `version` token and
  `DocumentSourceProvider`/`DocumentContentResolver` gain a `probeVersion` method
  (metadata-only, strictly cheaper than a full fetch), implemented across all
  document providers. The self-verifying cache stays enabled on the Cloudflare
  Worker (bounded staleness via the probe), unlike the mutable-state fragment
  catalog.

  Behavior change (pre-1.0, no back-compat): the durable `prompt_fragments.body` is
  now the offline fallback + management-view content, refreshed only by an explicit
  create/refresh; the live run-time body flows through the cache. Without a cache
  wired, a run serves the persisted body and does not re-resolve live.

- 6c1efd1: Docker Compose ephemeral envs: opt-in build-from-source mode.

  The Docker Compose environment backend was checkout-free / image-pull only and hard-rejected
  `build:`, host bind mounts, relative `env_file`, and `privileged`, so an app repo that builds
  its own images (e.g. a .NET + Angular + SQL Server stack) could not become a per-PR preview env.

  A new opt-in `build` mode (workspace handler `providerConfig.build`, mirrored advisory
  `ServiceProvisioning.composeBuild`) clones the PR head into a per-project working tree, writes
  the isolation-safe rewritten compose beside the original inside the checkout, and runs
  `docker compose build` + `up --wait`. In build mode `build:`, in-checkout relative bind mounts,
  and relative `env_file`s are honored. Image mode is unchanged and remains the default.

  Host-escape refusal is uniform across EVERY path-bearing reference, not just bind mounts: bind
  sources, `env_file`s, the `build:` context, and top-level `secrets:`/`configs:` `file:` sources are
  all run through `escapesCheckout`, which now also catches UNC/backslash-absolute paths, a
  separator-buried `../` source (`sub/../../../etc`, previously mis-read as a named volume), and an
  unresolved `${VAR}` interpolation (expands to an arbitrary host path at runtime). `include:` and
  cross-file `extends: { file }` are refused outright in both modes — the daemon merges those files
  from disk, so their services would otherwise slip a privileged container / host bind / pinned port
  past the parse-based guard. `privileged: true` stays refused.

  The `ComposeRuntime` seam gains optional `checkout`/`writeCheckoutFile` (implemented in the local
  facade via a shallow, token-authenticated git clone); `ProvisionEnvironmentRequest` gains a LAZY
  `clone` resolver (a thunk) invoked only by the build-mode provider that actually needs a working
  tree — so image-mode compose / custom / k8s-sync provisions no longer mint a short-lived VCS token
  they never use (reusing the deploy clone-target seam, memoized so one provision never mints twice).
  Build mode registers only on the docker-family local runtime — the documented runtime-bound
  exception. Build timeout is separate from the health-wait bound (`buildTimeoutMinutes`).

  Auto-detection is now content-aware: a compose stack that declares `build:` is detected and
  recommended in build-from-source mode (previously it was recommended blindly and then failed at
  provision time).

  The compose environment connect form gains an "Image source" selector (pull pre-built vs build
  from source) and a build-timeout field; the misleading "image-based stacks only" copy is removed.

### Minor Changes

- 6edcce0: Personal-PAT repo access + fail-closed board redaction, and removal of the legacy repo→block link.

  - **Expand the repo picker with your own PAT (all facades).** A user's stored GitHub PAT
    (`user_secrets` kind `github_pat`) now surfaces repos it can reach beyond the workspace's GitHub
    App grant — even on the hosted Cloudflare/Node facades. Linking one creates a **personal service**
    (`GitHubRepo.linkedVia === 'user_pat'`); runs against it already use the initiator's PAT.
  - **Fail-closed frame redaction.** A service frame backed by a repo linked via another member's PAT
    is hidden from members who can't reach it: the board snapshot scrubs the frame to just its
    internal id + a "Permission denied" placeholder and drops its subtree. Access is a fail-closed
    per-user projection (`github_user_repo_access`), refreshed when a user enumerates their PAT repos
    and cleared when they remove their PAT — no live GitHub call on the snapshot path.
  - **New:** `github_repos.linked_via` column + `github_user_repo_access` table (mirrored D1 ⇄
    Drizzle, with a cross-runtime conformance suite); kernel `UserRepoAccessRepository` port and
    optional `GitHubClient.listReposForToken`/`getRepoForToken`; `Block.accessDenied` +
    `GitHubAvailableRepo.personal` wire fields.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, no migration):** the legacy `github_repos.block_id` repo↔frame link is removed
  — the account-owned `Service` (`getByFrameBlock` → `repoGithubId`) is now the SOLE repo↔frame
  linkage. `RepoProjectionRepository.linkBlock` and `GitHubRepo.blockId` are gone; `resolveRepoTarget`
  now requires a `serviceRepository`; the `RepoBootstrapper` port's `linkRepoToBlock` is replaced by
  `projectBootstrappedRepo` (the caller binds the frame's `Service`). Existing rows' `block_id` is
  dropped; repos remain reachable through their `Service`.

### Minor Changes

- 47a2975: Initiatives slice 3 — the execution loop.

  An approved initiative plan now RUNS: a new `InitiativeLoopService` drives each `executing`
  initiative — reconciling its spawned tasks, spawning the next wave just-in-time, and completing
  the initiative once every tracker item settles.

  - **The loop** (`orchestration/modules/initiative/InitiativeLoopService.ts`): per-initiative
    `tick` = reconcile (fold each spawned task block's status back onto its item — done + PR link /
    `pr_open` / `blocked` + deviation, one batched block read, no N+1) → complete (all items settled
    → initiative + anchor block `done`, tracker re-commit, notify) → spawn (create task blocks for
    the eligible `pending` items — current phase, deps met, phase not halted — up to the concurrency
    cap, each pipeline chosen by the policy's estimate→pipeline rules). Spawning is CLAIM-FIRST (a
    rev-CAS write records the pre-generated block id before any side effect), so a concurrent ticker
    never orphans a double-spawn. A per-service task-limit conflict leaves the item `pending` for the
    next sweep; a missing pipeline (deleted after ingest) records a deviation + notification and
    blocks the item — the sweep never throws.
  - **Blocked = halt the phase, notify.** A blocked item stops new spawns in its phase (and keeps the
    phase current, so the initiative never advances past it) and raises the new `initiative`
    notification type; in-flight siblings finish. A human retries/skips the item to unblock.
  - **Both cron seams + terminal pokes.** `runDue` is wired into the Worker `scheduled` handler and a
    Node one-minute interval sweeper (symmetric). A settling child run pokes its owning initiative's
    loop immediately (`RunStateMachine.emitInstance` on a terminal run, `ExecutionService.finalizeMerge`
    on a merge), so work advances without waiting for the next sweep.
  - **Controls.** Pause / resume / cancel endpoints + `InitiativeService` CAS transitions; the sweep
    skips a non-`executing` initiative. The tracker window gains a live progress bar and the inspector
    the loop controls (`initiative.inspector.pause/resume/cancel`, all locales).
  - **`listExecuting()` now returns `{ workspaceId, initiative }[]`** (the entity carries no workspace
    id) — mirrored in the D1 + Drizzle repos and asserted, with the persisted loop-state round-trip,
    by the cross-runtime conformance suite.

  No new persistence (the `initiatives` table already exists on both facades) — so no D1/Drizzle
  migration and no executor-harness image bump.

### Minor Changes

- b928904: Service connections Phase 2 — multi-env provisioning. A `deployer` step now fans out over
  the task's own service frame PLUS each connected involved-service frame, provisioning one
  ephemeral environment per frame (dispatched provider-before-consumer, parked between), each
  keyed per `(blockId, frameId)` so the fan-out no longer clobbers itself. Already-ready peers
  are injected into a later provision as `{{input.peerEnvUrls}}`, the agent context gains
  `involvedServices` (title + connection description + the peer's live env URL, read-time
  stale-filtered), and the Tester infra spec gains a `peerEnvironments` map so a cross-service
  integration test can reach a peer's real environment.

### Minor Changes

- 55661f4: Add a public, key-authenticated external API (`/api/v1`) whose first use-case is "break down an
  initiative": an external system picks a public, inline pipeline and posts a brief, and the platform
  runs it headlessly and persists the result in the DB for asynchronous retrieval (poll
  `GET /api/v1/jobs/:id` or stream `GET /api/v1/jobs/:id/events` over SSE). Nothing is committed to
  GitHub — the run uses an inline agent (`initiative-breakdown`) with no container/repo.

  - Inbound public-API keys (`public_api_keys`, mirrored D1 ⇄ Drizzle) are revocable and stored as a
    one-way peppered hash (`HMAC-SHA256(secret, ENCRYPTION_KEY)`) — never plaintext, never
    recoverable. Managed per-workspace via `GET|POST|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/public-api-keys`; the raw
    key is shown once on create.
  - Runs are anchored on a headless `internal` block excluded from every board projection, so the
    external runs never appear in the UI.
  - Requires `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (the HMAC pepper); the surface 503s when unconfigured.

### Minor Changes

- 7fd6a19: Import-from-repo picker: find and link accessible repos in realtime instead of enumerating the whole installation and filtering in memory. The old path listed every installation repo (capped at a bounded page count) then substring-filtered client-of-the-cap — so on a wide App install a repo beyond that window returned "no matches" for a repo you actually had access to, and every keystroke re-fetched all pages. Two new `GitHubClient` primitives fix it end to end: `searchInstallationRepos` issues one bounded, account-scoped GitHub search per query, and `getRepoById` point-reads the picked repo by id when linking it (so a repo surfaced by search from beyond the enumeration cap links instead of spuriously 409-ing). Blank-query browse-all is unchanged; PAT (local) and GitLab connections filter their bounded token listing. When an installation has no resolvable account to scope the GitHub search to, the App adapter filters its own bounded listing rather than running an unscoped global search (which would surface arbitrary, unlinkable public repos).

### Patch Changes

- 0d51638: Harden three server-side SSRF surfaces:

  - **Local-runner allow-list** no longer treats a DNS hostname that merely starts with `fc`/`fd`
    (e.g. `fc2.com`) as a private IPv6 ULA — the ULA/loopback tests are now gated behind an
    "is IPv6 literal" check and the classification reuses the vetted kernel `ip-host` primitives.
  - **Runner-pool provider** (`HttpRunnerPoolProvider.execute`/`oauthToken`) and the shared
    `probeConnection` now follow redirects by hand and re-run the SSRF guard on every hop, so a
    permitted scheduler host can't 302 the secret-bearing dispatch body to an internal/metadata
    target. Factored the per-hop `safeFetch` + capped-read helpers into a shared module reused by
    the environment provider. `safeFetch` additionally drops the request body and strips
    credential headers (`authorization`/`cookie`/`proxy-authorization`) on any **cross-origin**
    redirect hop, so a permitted host also can't bounce the secrets to a _different_ public host
    (re-establishing the cross-origin credential stripping the platform `fetch` would have done,
    which the manual `redirect: 'manual'` follower had bypassed).
  - **Account-configured SearXNG web-search URL** is now validated (public host, http/https, no
    private/internal/metadata target) both at the write boundary and with per-hop revalidation on
    fetch.

- 0d51638: Secret-handling hardening:

  - **LLM telemetry** (`LlmObservabilityService`) now scrubs credential shapes from the
    prompt/response/reasoning bodies AND the `errorMessage` with a shared `redactSecrets`
    (promoted to `@cat-factory/kernel`, reused by the provisioning-log path) BEFORE anything is
    stored or fanned out to an external trace sink (Langfuse). `errorMessage` is kept as
    diagnostic metadata even when bodies are dropped and is fanned out ungated, so it is
    scrubbed too (an upstream 4xx/5xx string can echo an auth header). Prompt/response/reasoning
    body capture is additionally gated on the per-workspace `storeAgentContext` toggle (numeric
    telemetry is always recorded). Also fixed a latent O(n²) regex backtrack in the URL-userinfo
    redaction rule that a large prompt could trigger.
  - **Signed tokens** (`HmacSigner`) now derive an independent HKDF-SHA256 subkey per audience
    (`session`/`oauth-state`/`llm-proxy`/`ws`/`machine`), so a token class is cryptographically
    isolated rather than sharing one raw HMAC key. Key derivation is bounded to that fixed
    audience set — `verify` selects the key from the token's attacker-controlled claimed `aud`
    before the MAC check, so an unrecognised (or absent) audience falls back to the raw-secret
    base key rather than deriving+caching a fresh subkey, preventing an unbounded key-cache /
    per-request-HKDF DoS from a flood of junk-audience tokens. Breaking: any tokens signed before
    this change no longer verify (pre-1.0, no migration — clients re-authenticate).

### Minor Changes

- 5ce03c6: Frontend-config inspector: add repo autodetection, a frontend-directory field, clearer serve-mode
  help, and collapsible field groups.

  - **Detect from repo**: a new deterministic, checkout-free detector proposes a frontend config
    (package manager from the lockfile, install command, build script + output dir from
    package.json/framework markers, serve mode/script, and backend-binding env-var names from dotenv
    examples). Exposed as `POST /workspaces/:ws/environments/detect-frontend-config`
    (`detectFrontendConfig` on the environments connection service) and surfaced in the panel as a
    non-binding preview the user reviews and applies (backend bindings are appended, never
    overwriting existing service links).
  - **Frontend directory**: `FrontendConfig.directory` scopes a monorepo frontend's build/serve to a
    subdirectory (threaded into the harness job-body builder).
  - **Serve mode**: replaced the single hint with per-mode descriptions and a note distinguishing it
    from the separate env-injection axis.
  - **Grouping**: the panel's fields are now collapsible sections (Build / Serve / Mocking / Env
    injection / Backend bindings / Preview), collapsed by default.

### Minor Changes

- 05d1b08: refactor(integrations): app-own the user-secret-kind registry (registry DI migration)

  Migrates the per-user secret KIND registry off its module-global `Map` onto an app-owned
  instance, the next slice of the registry-DI initiative (see
  `docs/initiatives/registry-di-migration.md`). The composition root now owns the registry and
  injects it, so a deployment-registered custom kind is seen by reference regardless of module
  identity — the same footgun-free pattern as the environment/runner backend registries.

  - New `UserSecretKindRegistry` class (`register`/`get`/`list`) + `defaultUserSecretKindRegistry()`
    pre-loaded with the built-in `github_pat` kind, added to `BackendRegistries` /
    `createBackendRegistries()`. `UserSecretService` reads the injected registry.
  - **Breaking:** the free `registerUserSecretKind` / `getUserSecretKind` / `listUserSecretKinds`
    exports are removed (pre-1.0, no back-compat). The built-in kind is now the exported
    `githubPatUserSecretKind` handler, registered into the default registry.
  - Wired symmetrically into the Worker + Node facades (local inherits via `buildNodeContainer`);
    the cross-runtime conformance suite asserts a programmatically-registered custom kind is
    described identically on every runtime.

- 6243bea: Scope the "create task from a GitHub issue" picker's already-imported list to the
  target service's repo. The quick-pick list of imported issues was filtered only by
  source and free text, so it leaked in issues from every repo in the workspace even
  though the live search was already repo-scoped. `listTasks` now accepts an optional
  `blockId` that resolves the service's linked repo (via the same `resolveRepoTarget`
  the search uses) and drops GitHub issues from other repos; repo-less sources (Jira,
  Linear) are unaffected. The picker fetches its own repo-scoped list rather than
  reading the shared workspace-wide store.

## 0.54.1

### Patch Changes

- 2a91615: Frontend↔backend ephemeral-stack wiring (slice 6a of the frontend-preview initiative):

  - **Reverse CORS origin injection.** A `deployer` step now passes `inputs.frontendOrigins` — the
    comma-joined browser origins (`http://localhost:<servePort>`) of every `frontend` frame that
    binds the service being provisioned (the reverse of the frontend's `backendBindings`). A
    backend manifest folds it into its CORS allow-list via `{{input.frontendOrigins}}` (HTTP-manifest
    provider) or `{{frontendOrigins}}` (Kubernetes native adapter, flat scope), so an ephemeral
    frontend can reach an ephemeral backend. Derivation is automatic (`frontendOriginsForService`,
    a single workspace block-list read — no N+1); the CORS env-var mapping stays operator-authored,
    and the backend must be re-provisioned to pick up a newly-linked frontend. The served port is
    resolved through the shared `resolveFrontendServePort` (contracts) — the same reserved-port
    sanitization the harness infra spec uses — so a `servePort` set to a reserved in-container port
    (8080/8089) injects the port the app is actually served on (4173), not the raw value.
  - **Binding-resolution correctness.** `resolveFrontendBindings` now dedupes a repeated `envVar`
    deterministically (last non-empty binding wins, matching the injected env map) instead of leaving
    it to insertion order. New `duplicateBindingEnvVars` predicate (contracts) surfaces the collision
    for the inspector + run-start notes (a follow-up slice); it is advisory, not a schema reject
    (bindings persist per-blur with an allowed empty `envVar`).

  Runtime-neutral (all facades). The inspector visibility panel + run-detail projection (6b) and the
  deterministic local preview host port (6c) are tracked follow-ups in
  `docs/initiatives/frontend-preview-ui-testing.md`.

- 67d3876: feat(github): search available repos server-side in the "add service from repo" picker.
  The picker no longer prefetches the entire installation repo list on open (slow for a wide
  App install or PAT with hundreds of repos, and it blocked filtering until the whole list
  loaded). Instead the user types at least 3 characters and the (debounced) query is sent to
  `GET /github/available-repos?q=…`, which returns only the `owner/name` matches. The `q`
  param is optional, so the repo-link management panel's browse-all is unchanged. The now-moot
  manual "refresh list" button is removed (each search hits GitHub live).

### Patch Changes

- 63cf6de: Performance: batch reads, parallelize independent awaits, and push work into SQL on hot paths.

  - `GET /workspaces/:id` (the board-load endpoint) now fetches its ~15 independent snapshot
    ingredients concurrently instead of serially, so its latency is the slowest read rather
    than the sum of every round-trip; the create-workspace route parallelizes its spend +
    infra-setup reads the same way.
  - Agent-context reference lookups (Jira keys / GitHub refs / URLs) run concurrently on the
    per-step dispatch path; run-start model-default resolutions run concurrently per agent kind.
  - New batched port methods, mirrored on both runtimes with conformance coverage:
    `BlockRepository.findByIds` (cross-workspace dependency resolution — one chunked query
    instead of a point-read per id, also allow-listed for mothership mode),
    `NotificationRepository.escalateStaleOpen` (the escalation sweep is now one
    `UPDATE … RETURNING` statement instead of a load-filter-upsert loop), and
    `GitHubInstallationRepository.listByInstallationIds` (connect-UI annotation).
  - GitHub webhook fan-out resolves linked workspaces via the existing batched
    `linkedWorkspaces` read instead of a per-workspace point-read on every delivery.
  - The Node Drizzle GitHub projections write chunked multi-row upserts (matching the D1
    twins' `db.batch`) instead of one round-trip per row, and their list reads run
    `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` in SQL (NULLS LAST for D1 parity) instead of sorting full result
    sets in JS.
  - `autoStartDependents` hoists the invariant workspace-pipeline read out of its loop and
    stops re-fetching blocks it already holds.
  - Session/WS-ticket/machine-token verification reuses a memoized `HmacSigner` per secret,
    so `crypto.subtle.importKey` no longer runs on every request (`signerFor` export).
  - The Cloudflare Workflows drivers (execution / bootstrap / env-config-repair) build the
    DI container once per wake instead of once per `step.do` poll tick.

### Minor Changes

- dcc8b32: Browsable frontend preview — transport dispatch + `PreviewService` + controller + stop (slice 5c of
  the frontend-preview + in-context UI-testing initiative,
  docs/initiatives/frontend-preview-ui-testing.md).

  Wire the harness `preview` mode (slice 5b) end to end: a `frontend` frame can now be built and
  served on a HOST-reachable URL for a browsable preview, and stopped again. New pieces:

  - A new optional `PreviewTransport` kernel port — the per-runtime half that publishes a served
    app's port to an ephemeral host port and keeps the container alive past the build job. The local
    facade wires the real one over its Docker/Podman/OrbStack/Colima/Apple adapter (a second
    published port read back with `docker port` / the container IP); the Worker never wires it.
  - A runtime-neutral `PreviewService` (start / get / stop) that persists the running preview like an
    ephemeral `environments` row keyed by the `frontend` frame (reusing the existing table + soft-delete
    stop path — no new migration), plus a `PreviewController` mounting
    `GET|POST|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/frames/:frameId/preview`, gated server-side on the
    `frontendPreview.supported` capability (503 on the Worker).
  - The cross-runtime conformance suite drives the full start → serve → stop lifecycle on both Postgres
    runtimes with a fake transport, pinning the ephemeral-env-row persistence parity.

  Notes:

  - `frontendPreview.supported` now tracks whether a preview transport is actually wired: a stock Node
    build (runner pool, no host-port-publish primitive) advertises `false`, so the SPA never offers a
    Start button that would 503; local mode (and any facade injecting a `previewTransport`) advertises
    `true`.
  - Preview rows share the `environments` table but carry a dedicated `preview` discriminator (outside
    `provisionTypeSchema`), so the environment subsystem filters them out of its generic listing +
    block-resolution paths — a preview never leaks into the deployer-env UI or tester env resolution.
  - `PreviewService.get` re-polls a `ready` preview so a vanished/evicted container stops reporting a
    stale, unreachable URL (it flips to `failed`); a healthy preview whose URL merely can't be
    re-derived keeps its authoritative persisted URL.

  Local/node differentiator; the SPA surface (the clickable URL + a stop button on the frame inspector)
  lands in slice 5d. The harness is unchanged (no runner-image bump).

- 9b26ff1: feat(frontend): key a deployer's ephemeral env by its service FRAME so a live `service` binding
  resolves (slice 4b of the frontend-preview + in-context UI-testing initiative,
  docs/initiatives/frontend-preview-ui-testing.md).

  A `frontend` frame's `service` binding names a service FRAME id, but a `deployer` keyed its
  ephemeral env only under the task `block_id` it ran on — so `resolveFrontendConfig`'s
  `handle === serviceBlockId` match never hit and a live-service binding fell back to WireMock even
  when the backend's env was up (the deferred keying gap slices 3/4 flagged).

  The env now also records the resolved service `frame_id` (the deployer's block walked up to its
  enclosing frame), and the frontend binding resolution matches handles on THAT. The task-keyed
  `block_id` — and the same-block deployer→tester env projection that reads it — is unchanged; this
  is an additive column, not a re-key.

  - **New `frame_id` column** on `environments`, mirrored D1 (`0030_environment_frame_id.sql`) ⇄
    Drizzle (`environments.frame_id` + generated migration), threaded through `EnvironmentRecord`,
    the `EnvironmentHandle` wire shape, and both registry repos.
  - **Keying**: `RunDispatcher.deployerProvisionArgs` resolves the service frame id via the shared
    frame walk and passes it on `ProvisionArgs.frameId`; the provisioning service persists it on both
    the provisioned and the failed-record paths.
  - **Resolution**: `AgentContextBuilder.resolveFrontendConfig` indexes the single `listHandles` read
    by `handle.frameId` (still one batch read, no per-binding point read), so a `service` binding
    resolves to its live ephemeral URL — and the frontend UI-test infra gate is satisfied instead of
    refusing the run.
  - **Conformance**: a new cross-runtime assertion provisions a service frame's env via a `deployer`,
    then a UI-tester run against a frontend bound to that frame STARTS (the mirror of the existing
    no-live-service refusal), pinning both the `frame_id` D1 ⇄ Drizzle round-trip and the
    frame-keyed resolution.

- f21279e: Warn when required infrastructure is undefined. The workspace snapshot now carries an
  `infraSetup` projection (computed server-side in `WorkspaceController` from whatever the
  deployment actually wired) that tracks three areas explicitly as `not_defined` /
  `configured` / `not_applicable`:

  - **Ephemeral environments** (all runtimes that wire the environments integration) —
    `not_defined` when no environment provider connection is registered, so testing agents
    that need a live environment can't run.
  - **Agent executor** (stock/remote Node only — Cloudflare has built-in per-run containers, and
    local mode runs agents in per-run HOST containers) — `not_defined` when no self-hosted runner
    pool is registered, so NO container agents can run. This area fires only where the pool is the
    SOLE executor (the new `agentExecutorRequiresRunnerPool` container flag, set by the Node facade
    when it uses the default pool transport); Cloudflare and local both wire the runner surface but
    keep a built-in executor, so the pool is optional there and the area is `not_applicable` — a bare
    `!!container.runners` check would otherwise falsely nag on every local deployment.
  - **Binary storage** (remote Node only — Cloudflare binds R2, local defaults to a filesystem
    store) — `not_defined` when the account selected no content-storage backend, so UI
    screenshots / reference images have nowhere to live.

  The SPA surfaces each `not_defined` area as a loud, per-area setup banner with a deep-link
  into the relevant configuration. Dismissing a banner asks whether to hide it just for this
  session (re-nags next load) or permanently — "I'm OK with the limitations, don't notify me
  again" — the latter persisted per-user in localStorage.

  The advisory top-of-board banners (AI-readiness, provider-config, infra-setup) now render in a
  single shared, click-through column so concurrent prompts on a fresh deployment stack vertically
  instead of drawing on top of each other. The `RunnerPoolConnectionService` and
  `EnvironmentConnectionService` gain a `hasConnection` presence probe (no secret decrypt) that the
  projection uses on the hot board-load path.

  Each area probe is additionally bounded by a timeout and its swallowed faults are logged, so a slow
  or misconfigured backend read degrades that area to `not_applicable` (advisory-only, never 500s or
  stalls the board load) while staying diagnosable. The banner's permanent-dismissal `localStorage`
  key + the infra-setup area list are exported from `@cat-factory/contracts`
  (`INFRA_SETUP_DISMISSED_STORAGE_KEY` / `INFRA_SETUP_AREAS`) so the SPA and the e2e seed share one
  source of truth, and the stacked banner cards announce through a single polite live region instead
  of one assertive alert each.

### Patch Changes

- ab7d589: feat(infra): view, retest and safely edit a stored Kubernetes test-environment connection

  The Test-environments Kubernetes handler previously only offered a delete: opening the edit form
  cleared the write-only ServiceAccount token, so "Test connection" on a saved connection always
  failed auth (no token) and re-saving a non-secret tweak silently wiped the stored token.

  - Backend (`EnvironmentConnectionService` + `EnvironmentUserHandlerService`, runtime-neutral):
    `testHandler` now falls back to the SAVED handler's stored secret, so an established connection
    can be tested (or a non-secret field edited and tested) without re-entering the token; a
    freshly-typed value still overrides it. Saving a handler now PRESERVES stored secrets the
    operator left blank (a blank/omitted secret means "keep it") and replaces them only when a new
    value is supplied. Shared `overlaySecrets` helper; no schema change.
  - Frontend: the Kubernetes engine form shows when a token is already saved, makes the token
    optional on edit ("leave blank to keep"), and enables Test against the stored token. The
    handler list now frames each entry as an established connection with a prominent connected
    checkbox and an inline Test-connection button.

### Patch Changes

- d4d4cbc: Make credential-decryption failures actionable and isolate them.

  Previously, a stored secret sealed under a rotated/regenerated `ENCRYPTION_KEY` surfaced as
  the opaque Web Crypto `OperationError` ("The operation failed for an operation-specific
  reason") with no context — e.g. an inline requirements-review run failed at step 0 with that
  bare message and no detail, because the reviewer leases + decrypts the workspace's provider
  API keys before any LLM call (outside its own error-wrapping).

  - `WebCryptoSecretCipher.decrypt` now rethrows an actionable error on an AES-GCM auth failure,
    naming `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the likely key-rotation cause, preserving the original as `cause`.
  - `ApiKeyService.lease` wraps a decrypt failure with the offending provider + key id.
  - `createScopedModelProviderResolver.forScope` no longer lets ONE provider's undecryptable key
    sink the whole scoped provider: it registers a deferred-failure resolver for that provider, so
    calls targeting a different, healthy provider still resolve and only a call that actually needs
    the broken provider fails (with the real cause).

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- 3643708: Custom manifest types can now declare an optional `defaultManifestPath` and `fixerPrompt`.
  A `custom` service prefills its manifest path from the type's default on selection, and
  "Detect from repo" resolves the path monorepo-aware (keep an accurate current value; else
  the exact default within the service subtree/repo root; else, for a bare filename, one level
  deep; else pre-fill the default location). A new **Generate / fix manifest** button (shown
  only when the type defines a `fixerPrompt`) dispatches the fixer coding agent — reusing the
  durable `env-config-repair` run — to create the manifest at the entered path or fix it when
  invalid, after best-effort `validateRepo`. Adds the `default_manifest_path` / `fixer_prompt`
  columns to `custom_manifest_types` on both runtimes (D1 + Drizzle).

### Patch Changes

- b744822: Surface a Kubernetes environment that can't finish provisioning instead of leaving it spinning up forever.

  Two gaps let a misconfigured ephemeral-environment (bad/insufficient ServiceAccount token, missing RBAC, or a rollout that never completes) sit at `provisioning` indefinitely with nothing shown in the run's "Infrastructure attempts":

  - `KubernetesEnvironmentProvider`'s status read mapped **every** non-OK apiserver response — including `401`/`403` — to `provisioning`. A credential/permission error never self-heals, so the env never left "spinning up". It now throws a clear error on `401`/`403` (caught + logged by `refreshStatus`, after which the human-test gate degrades to manual mode) while transient `5xx`/`429` still keep polling.
  - `EnvironmentProvisioningService.refreshStatus` only recorded a provisioning-log entry when the status read **threw**, so a reconciliation that flipped the env to `failed` without throwing (e.g. a rollout that exceeded its progress deadline, or a vanished namespace) left the "Infrastructure attempts" drawer empty. It now records a `failure` entry on the transition into `failed`.

- c40736e: Simplify the Kubernetes integration module internally (behaviour-preserving).

  - Remove the unused `isSupportedKind()` export from `kubernetes-environment.logic.ts`.
  - Drop the `KubernetesEnvironmentProvider`'s private `renderImage()`, which duplicated the
    shared `renderTemplate()`, and derive the per-PR namespace + template vars once through a
    single `provisionContext()` helper reused by `provision`, `buildProvisionJob`, and
    `finalizeProvision`.
  - Collapse the repeated apiserver GET/parse and "by name, else first in list" logic in the
    status/URL reads behind two small `getJson`/`getByNameOrFirst` helpers.
  - Share the custom-TLS runtime-support check between the runner and environment backends via
    a new `assertCustomTlsSupported()` in `kubernetes.logic.ts`.

  No functional or wire-shape changes; covered by the existing unit suite.

## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- 77c6842: Broaden the provisioning auto-detector and make it monorepo-aware with user-selectable candidates.

  - **More layouts recognized.** Compose detection now covers override/env-variant names
    (`compose.override.*`, `docker-compose.override.*`, `docker-compose.{prod,dev}.*`) and files nested
    under `deploy/` / `docker/` / `.docker/` / `compose/`. Kubernetes detection adds common roots
    (`charts`, `chart`, `helm`, `kustomize`, `.kube`, `infra`, `infrastructure`, `infra/manifests`,
    `deploy/k8s`, `deploy/kubernetes`, `config/k8s`, `ops`, `gitops`, `.deploy`) and nested wrapper
    subdirs (`overlays`, `base`, `helm`, `charts`, `kustomize`).
  - **Monorepo-aware.** When scoped to a service subdirectory, the detector checks both the colocated
    service folder AND the repo's root shared-deploy dirs (`deploy/<svc>`, `k8s/<svc>`,
    `manifests/services/<svc>`, …), matching the service's slice by its directory basename. Unrelated
    slices are not surfaced when colocated manifests already win, and a name-matched slice with no
    confirmable manifests is only pre-selected when it actually matches the service name (never a
    fabricated pick at an arbitrary directory).
  - **Choose instead of silent auto-pick.** The recommendation now surfaces `serviceDirCandidates`
    (which root-shared monorepo slice), `manifestRootCandidates` (which k8s root when several resolve),
    and `composeServiceCandidates` (which compose service) alongside the existing overlay candidates, each
    rendered as a selectable chip in the service inspector's "Detect from repo" panel.

  The recommendation's new fields are optional; nothing is persisted by detection. The compose service key
  is advisory (surfaced as a candidate/note only) — it is not written onto the service provisioning.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- 79a0f48: Wire the programmatic custom provision-type catalog (`CustomManifestTypeRegistry`)
  into every facade so a code-registered `custom` manifest type is actually visible.
  Previously a deployment/provider package could register a custom manifest type, but
  no runtime constructed or injected the registry, so `listCustomTypes` always saw an
  empty registered set — the type never appeared in the infrastructure custom-type
  editor or the per-service provisioning picker.

  `customManifestTypeRegistry` now belongs to `BackendRegistries` (built by
  `createBackendRegistries()`), and the Cloudflare + Node facades thread it into
  `createCore` (local inherits via `buildNodeContainer`). A deployment registers a
  type by reference — `registries.customManifestTypeRegistry.register({ manifestId,
label, … })` — exactly like a custom environment/runner backend. The cross-runtime
  conformance suite now asserts a registered type surfaces in the handlers bundle
  (`source: 'registered'`) on both runtimes.

## 0.48.2

### Patch Changes

- 2e1354f: Improve the Kubernetes per-type engine configurator:

  - **k3s feedback** — picking the `local-k3s` engine now prefills the engine form's loopback
    defaults (API server `https://127.0.0.1:6443`, label, skip-TLS) and shows a hint banner that
    explains the prefill and how to mint a ServiceAccount token, instead of leaving the form
    unchanged. Switching back to `remote-kubernetes` clears those local-only defaults. k3s/k3d/kind
    share the same loopback defaults, so they remain one preset rather than separate options.
  - **Test connection** — the Kubernetes engine form (workspace + per-user override) gains a working
    "Test connection" button. A new `POST /workspaces/:ws/environments/handlers/test` endpoint lowers
    the engine config to a backend config and reaches the apiserver with the supplied token (nothing
    persisted), reusing the existing connection-probe path. Reported as `{ ok, message }`.

## 0.48.1

### Patch Changes

- 66a8c71: Fix Kubernetes provisioning auto-detection missing manifests nested under a `deploy/`
  or `deployment/` wrapper.

  `findKubernetesRoot` only inspected each candidate directory directly, so a standard
  helm/kustomize layout that lives one level deeper (e.g. `deployment/k8s/{base,overlays}`,
  as in `kibertoad/simpler-service3`) was reported as `infraless`. The detector now descends
  one level into a `k8s` / `kubernetes` / `manifests` child of any candidate wrapper dir and
  evaluates that as the manifest root, so the nested overlay tree, renderer, namespace, and
  image overrides are detected correctly.

## 0.48.0

### Minor Changes

- b4c7e60: Provisioning auto-detection now prioritizes the option matching the user's selected
  provision-type tab.

  The "Detect from repo" affordance sends the currently-selected tab (`kubernetes` vs
  `docker-compose`) as a new optional `prefer` field on `POST /environments/detect-provisioning`.
  The detector honors it: on the `docker-compose` tab a compose file wins when present (even if
  Kubernetes manifests also exist, surfaced as a low-confidence "switch to kubernetes" hint),
  falling back to the other kind when the preferred one isn't found. With no preference (or any
  non-compose tab) it keeps the historical kubernetes-first order, so existing behavior is
  unchanged unless a caller opts in.

### Minor Changes

- 41203db: Per-service provision types (slice 11): auto-detect a recommended Kubernetes provisioning
  config from a service's repo.

  A deterministic, pure-TS heuristic detector reads a service's repo checkout-free over the
  `RepoFiles` port and proposes a NON-BINDING recommended provisioning config. High-confidence
  facts are inferred deterministically (renderer from a `kustomization.yaml`; the URL source from
  the manifest kinds — `Ingress`/`Gateway`/`HTTPRoute`/`LoadBalancer Service`; a pinned namespace;
  `generatorEnvFile` secret injections with keys read from a `.env.example`; image overrides
  defaulting the tag to `{{branch}}`); ambiguous ones (which `overlays/*` is the ephemeral one,
  helm releases from a `helmfile.yaml`/`Chart.yaml`) are surfaced as candidates with a hint
  rather than guessed. The user always confirms/edits — nothing is applied silently.

  - Contracts: `provisioningRecommendationSchema` + `detectServiceProvisioningSchema` +
    `detectServiceProvisioningContract` (`POST /workspaces/:ws/environments/detect-provisioning`).
  - `EnvironmentConnectionService.detectServiceProvisioning` runs the detector over the
    workspace-bound `RepoFiles`; new `provision-detect.logic.ts` with unit tests.
  - Frontend: a "Detect from repo" affordance in the service inspector's test-infra section that
    prefills `block.provisioning` + surfaces the per-field confidence notes, overlay candidates,
    and engine-level URL/namespace suggestions; new i18n keys across all 8 locales.

  No migration (detection is pure repo introspection — nothing persisted).

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- cb9e2e3: Per-service provision types (Phase 2, slice 10): facade wiring for the async, container-backed
  Kubernetes deploy lifecycle + the local-mode native-CLI deploy transport. A `deployer` step whose
  manifests need rendering (kustomize/helm/Gateway-API) now stands its environment up in a real
  deploy container (or, locally, the host CLIs) on every runtime — slice 9's `deployJobClient` /
  `resolveDeployCloneTarget` seams are no longer unwired. The synchronous raw-manifest REST path is
  unchanged.

  - **Cloudflare Worker**: a new `DeployContainer` Durable Object (per-run, the separate
    deploy-harness image — `kubectl`/`kustomize`/`helm`) bound as `DEPLOY_CONTAINER`, with its
    `[[containers]]` block + binding + a `v4` migration in both wranglers and the class exported from
    the worker entry. The `image: 'deploy'` dispatch routes here while agent jobs stay on
    `ExecutionContainer`. `selectDeployDeps` wires a deploy-dedicated `RunnerJobClient` (over the
    deploy namespace) + `resolveDeployCloneTarget` when the binding + GitHub App are present.
  - **Node**: wires the default pool-backed `deployJobClient` (`new RunnerJobClient(resolveTransport)`)
    - a `resolveDeployCloneTarget` built from the App token mint, both overridable by a sibling facade.
      The self-hosted runner pool now forwards the `image` dispatch option (the generic
      `RunnerPoolTransport` + `HttpRunnerPoolProvider` expose it as a first-class `{{input.image}}`
      variable, and the native Kubernetes runner config gains an `imageDeploy` variant) so a pool pulls
      the deploy-harness image for `image: 'deploy'`.
  - **Local**: a new `NativeCliDeployTransport` (`LOCAL_DEPLOY_RUNTIME=native|container`). `native`
    (default) runs the deploy harness as a host process driving the developer's own
    `kubectl`/`kustomize`/`helm`; `container` runs the deploy image per job, keyed by its own job id so
    it never collides with the run's agent container. The clone target is inherited from Node's default
    (PAT mint + GitLab-aware origin).
  - **Shared**: `@cat-factory/server` exports `makeResolveDeployCloneTarget` (compose a deploy clone
    resolver from a repo-target walk + token mint, with a per-facade clone-URL override).
  - **Conformance**: the cross-runtime suite drives the engine's async render path on every facade —
    it forwards the provider's `deploy` kind + `image: 'deploy'` option through the wired client, polls
    a stubbed view, and finalizes — asserting the finalized record round-trips through each facade's
    real registry repo to an identical `ProvisionedEnvironment` on D1 and Postgres. (The per-facade
    transport selection is out of this runtime-neutral suite's scope; only local's selection has a
    dedicated unit test today.)

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [cb9e2e3]

## 0.45.0

### Minor Changes

- 1e55e77: Per-service provision types (Phase 2, slice 9): the async, container-backed deployer lifecycle.
  A `deployer` step can now stand an environment up in a deploy container (real
  `kubectl`/`kustomize`/`helm`) — dispatch the job, park the run, poll it, and finalize the
  outcome — instead of only the synchronous in-Worker REST path. The synchronous raw-manifest
  path is unchanged.

  - `EnvironmentProvisioningService` gains the async lifecycle alongside `provision()`:
    `startProvision(args, ref)` resolves the provider and either provisions SYNCHRONOUSLY (raw
    manifests — returns a final `completed` handle) or, when the provider's
    `asyncProvision.buildProvisionJob` returns a job, DISPATCHES a `deploy`-kind job and persists
    a `provisioning` env record (so run details show the env spinning up), returning `dispatched`
    with the job ref. `pollProvisionJob` polls the deploy job's view; `finalizeProvision` maps a
    terminal view into the env record (a `failed` view → a `failed` env carrying the harness
    error); `releaseProvisionJob` reclaims the runner. Two new optional deps wire the transport:
    `deployJobClient` (the facade's `RunnerJobClient`, typed structurally so integrations stays
    runtime-neutral) and `resolveDeployCloneTarget` (the VCS-specific manifests-repo clone URL +
    ref + short-lived token). Unwired ⇒ a render-needing config fails loudly; the synchronous path
    is unaffected. The shared `provision()` internals (`resolveProvision` /
    `buildProvisionRequest` / `provisionSync` / `recordProvisioned` / `captureProvisionFailure`)
    were extracted so the sync and async paths can't drift.
  - `RunDispatcher.runDeployerStep` now dispatches via `startProvision` and parks on `awaiting_job`
    for an async deploy job (re-attaching on replay via `step.jobId`); a new `pollDeployerJob`
    branch in `pollAgentJob` drives the deploy poll — surfacing live container/subtask progress,
    recovering a container eviction by re-dispatching a fresh deploy job within the same budgets as
    the agent path, and finalizing a terminal view into the step result. The infraless no-op and
    the legacy single-connection fallback are unchanged. The deploy job ref is DETERMINISTIC (run
    id + deployer kind + eviction epoch, via the new `deployer.logic.ts` helpers) so a Workflows
    replay re-attaches instead of dispatching a duplicate container; a status-read failure during
    the poll propagates to the driver (so its `jobPollFailureTolerance` fast-fail applies, matching
    `pollAgentJob`) rather than being swallowed; and a non-eviction terminal failure marks the
    deploy container `errored`.
  - `CoreDependencies` threads `deployJobClient` + `resolveDeployCloneTarget` into
    `createEnvironmentsModule`'s provisioning service (optional). The facades wire them in slice 10,
    so both runtimes share the identical (unwired) behaviour for now — nothing dispatches a deploy
    job until slice 10's facade wiring + deploy-dispatch conformance lands.

  Review fixes folded into the slice:

  - On a successful async deploy, `completeDeployerStep` now re-projects the environment, so the
    deployer step's Environment panel shows the final `ready` env + URL instead of staying stuck on
    the dispatch-time `provisioning` snapshot.
  - A terminal deploy job (done or a genuine failure) now releases its runner via
    `releaseProvisionJob`, so the one-shot deploy container is reclaimed instead of idling out its
    `sleepAfter` window / leaking a self-hosted pool slot (the agent path's `stopRunContainer`,
    run-id keyed + final-step only, never covered the separately dispatched deploy job).
  - The `provisioning` env record `startProvision` writes after dispatch is now best-effort: a failed
    projection write no longer propagates (which the caller turns into a terminal, non-retried failure
    that would strand the live deploy container).
  - The deployer step now PINS its resolved provisioning config (`PipelineStep.deployProvisioning`) at
    dispatch, so the poll/finalize maps the job against the config the container was built from rather
    than a fresh frame read a person may have edited mid-flight (e.g. flipping to `infraless`).
  - The deploy container's terminal `errored` stamp now keys off the RESOLVED env status, so a `done`
    view the provider maps to a failed env (harness exited 0, namespace missing) no longer shows the
    container "up".
  - The eviction-recovery + subtask-progress logic shared with `pollAgentJob` is extracted into
    `recoverContainerEviction` / `applySubtaskProgress`, so the eviction budgets, the "still
    evicting…" wording, and the progress-fraction math live in one place for both paths.

## 0.44.0

### Minor Changes

- 858799e: Per-service provision types (Phase 2, slice 8): the `KubernetesEnvironmentProvider` render
  path. The provider now implements the `asyncProvision` capability — it builds a
  container-backed deploy job (real `kubectl`/`kustomize`/`helm`) for any config the in-Worker
  REST path can't handle, and maps the harness outcome back into a `ProvisionedEnvironment`.

  - `buildProvisionJob` returns a `deploy`-kind job (`image: 'deploy'`) when the source needs
    rendering (`renderer: 'kustomize'`) or declares helm releases / image overrides / secret
    injections, and `null` (use the synchronous REST `provision()` path) for plain raw
    manifests. Every template is rendered and every `secretRef` is resolved backend-side, so
    the job body the harness receives carries concrete values only.
  - `finalizeProvision` maps the harness's `DeployOutcome` (namespace / url / status) onto a
    `ProvisionedEnvironment`; a failed job becomes a `failed` environment carrying the error.
  - The native REST `status()` path gained the Gateway-API URL resolvers — `gatewayStatus`
    (prefer a concrete listener hostname over the assigned address) and `httpRouteStatus` (the
    route's own hostname, else the parent Gateway's address read in the parentRef's namespace)
    — so a kustomize/Gateway env resolves its URL on ongoing status polls. REST teardown/status
    are otherwise unchanged.
  - Contracts: a `kubernetesProvisionConfigSchema` (the combined cluster + URL + manifest source
    config PLUS the render inputs) is what the deploy adapter consumes; `EnvironmentConnectionService`
    merges the service's render inputs (image overrides, per-environment helm releases, secret
    injections) with the workspace engine config (shared helm releases) at provision time.
  - Kernel: `DeployCloneTarget` + `DeployProvisionInputs` (the clone coordinates + git token + job
    ref the stateless provider can't derive itself) on `ProvisionEnvironmentRequest`, supplied by
    the provisioning service before dispatch.
  - Deploy harness: when per-PR isolation is NOT requested, the harness now reads the namespace the
    built manifests actually declare (an overlay's own `namespace:`) and ensures / monitors /
    reports / tears down THAT namespace instead of the backend's per-PR default — so an
    overlay-pinned (shared) namespace no longer leaves an empty namespace behind with no URL and a
    wrong-target teardown. Image tag bumped to `0.2.2`.
  - A new optional `rolloutTimeoutSeconds` on the kube engine config is forwarded to the deploy
    job (the harness's per-Deployment rollout wait); `buildDeployJobSpec` now fails fast when the
    cluster `apiToken` secret is unset instead of dispatching an unauthenticated job. Same-named
    shared/per-env helm releases are merged by name (service overrides engine — no double install).

  The async deployer lifecycle (dispatch/poll/park) and facade wiring follow in slices 9–10, so
  nothing dispatches a deploy job yet; this slice adds + unit-tests the provider methods.

## 0.43.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bb75b0: Per-service provision types (slices 3 + 4): the deployer engine step + run-details recording,
  and the per-type handler controllers + container wiring.

  Slice 3 — engine step:

  - The `deployer` step now resolves the SERVICE frame's declared `provisioning` and routes to the
    workspace handler for its type (merging the service's manifest source). A service declaring
    `infraless` records a no-op step output (nothing provisioned); an undeclared service falls
    through to the legacy single-connection path. The resolved provision type + engine are recorded
    on the `EnvironmentRecord` (success and failed paths) and surfaced on the step output
    (`Provision type:` / `Engine:` lines + `model: environment:<engine>:<providerId>`).
  - `EnvironmentProvisioningService.provision` gains an `initiatedBy` arg and a
    `resolveUserHandlerOverrides` seam: in local mode the run initiator's per-user handler
    overrides layer over the workspace handlers.

  Slice 4 — controllers + wiring:

  - New per-type infra handler HTTP surface on `EnvironmentController` (workspace-scoped): a batched
    `GET …/environments/handlers` bundle (handlers + custom-type catalog), `POST …/handlers`,
    `PATCH …/handlers/:provisionType/secrets`, `DELETE …/handlers/:provisionType`, plus custom-type
    CRUD (`PUT|DELETE …/environments/custom-types/:manifestId`).
  - New **local-mode-only** `EnvironmentUserHandlerController` mounted at the root
    (`GET /me/environment-handlers/:workspaceId`, `PUT|DELETE …/:provisionType`), backed by the new
    `EnvironmentUserHandlerService`. The service + per-user overrides are wired ONLY by the local
    facade (Worker/Node 503 the controller and ignore user overrides), enforced purely by container
    wiring.
  - `customManifestTypeRepository` is wired on all three facades (workspace catalog CRUD);
    `environmentUserHandlerRepository` only on the local facade.
  - The handler validation/lowering is extracted to a shared `buildInfraHandlerFields` helper used by
    both the workspace and per-user stores. Cross-runtime conformance asserts the per-type handler
    CRUD + custom-type CRUD + the `infraless` deployer no-op on every facade.

### Minor Changes

- f383515: Per-service provision types (slice 2c — tester collapse). **Breaking:** the per-task/per-service
  `local` vs `ephemeral` Tester toggle is gone. A service's declared `provisioning` config now
  drives the Tester's infra entirely, so these are removed (BC is a non-goal — stale rows/columns
  are simply dropped):

  - the `Block` fields `defaultTestEnvironment`, `testComposePath`, `noInfraDependencies` (folded
    into `provisioning.type` / `provisioning.composePath`) — dropped from the contract, the shared
    block mapper, and the D1 (`0026_drop_tester_env_columns.sql`) + Drizzle block columns;
  - the `tester.environment` agent-config descriptor (`@cat-factory/agents`) and its prompt/job-body
    consumers — the Tester's run mode is now derived from the service's provision type;
  - the `delegateTestEnvToProvider` workspace setting (+ its D1/Drizzle column) and the local-facade
    `resolveTesterFallbackDefault` / `resolveRequireEnvironmentProvider` wiring.

  The start-time Tester gate is rewritten: it passes for an `infraless` (or undeclared) service,
  refuses a `docker-compose` service on a runtime that can't nest containers OR with no compose
  path declared (`tester_infra_unsupported` — "limited mode" / "nothing to stand up"), and requires
  a resolvable workspace handler for a `kubernetes`/`custom` service (`provision_type_unhandled`, via
  the new `EnvironmentConnectionService.resolveHandlerForType` /
  `EnvironmentProvisioningService.canProvision` seam). The Tester's run mode (the `infra` job spec +
  the prompt run-mode line, kept in lock-step) is derived from the provision type AND the run's
  provisioned environment: a service that actually provisioned an env URL (e.g. via a `deployer`
  step) tests against it regardless of declared type, and an undeclared service runs with no infra.
  The agent-executor `service` context carries `provisioning` instead of the three legacy fields. The
  service inspector replaces the local/ephemeral toggle with a provision-type selector.

### Minor Changes

- 337d94d: Per-service provision types (slice 2b — reshape `environment_connections` + handler-aware
  service). **Breaking:** `environment_connections` is rekeyed from a single per-workspace
  provider binding (`(workspace_id, provider_id)`, discriminated by `kind`) into a multi-row
  per-provision-type HANDLER table `(workspace_id, provision_type, manifest_id)` with
  `engine` / `backend_kind` / `accepts_manifest_id` columns and `handler_json` (was
  `manifest_json`); pre-reshape rows are dropped (BC is a non-goal). The kernel
  `EnvironmentConnectionRepository` port becomes a multi-row API (`listByWorkspace`,
  `getByWorkspaceAndType`, `upsert`, per-type `softDelete`), mirrored in the D1 + Drizzle repos
  and the cross-runtime conformance suite.

  `EnvironmentConnectionService` gains the final handler-aware API — `registerHandler` /
  `listHandlers` / `updateHandlerSecrets` / `unregisterHandler`, custom-manifest-type CRUD, and
  `resolveProviderForType`, which matches a service's declared provisioning to a workspace
  handler and **merges the service-owned `manifestSource` into the engine config** at resolve
  time (the what/where ÷ how split). `EnvironmentProvisioningService.provision` accepts the
  service's `provisioning` and resolves per-type (short-circuiting `infraless`). A new
  `provision_type_unhandled` conflict reason is added (wire vocabulary + SPA title).

  The existing single-connection HTTP surface (register/describe/test/connection endpoints) is
  preserved as a thin **compat bridge** over the new table, so the current infrastructure UI
  keeps working unchanged; the per-type HTTP endpoints + the frontend rebuild follow in later
  slices, as does the tester collapse (dropping `defaultTestEnvironment`).

### Minor Changes

- 1952d6b: Per-service provision types (slice 2a — resolver + registry engine metadata). Adds the
  pure `resolveInfraHandler` resolution (service provision type → the workspace/user handler
  that serves it, per-user override winning, `infraless` → the `none` engine, ambiguous bare
  `custom` rejected), `engines()`/`acceptsManifestIds()` metadata + a `byEngine` lookup on the
  environment-backend registry (the built-ins map kubernetes → `local-k3s`/`remote-kubernetes`,
  compose → `local-docker`, manifest → `remote-custom`), and the app-owned
  `CustomManifestTypeRegistry` + `aggregateCustomManifestTypes` catalog seam. Kernel re-exports
  the new provision-type contract types. Pure/additive — the connection-table reshape, service
  consumption, and tester collapse follow in slice 2b.

### Patch Changes

- 1952d6b: Per-service provision types (slice 1 — additive foundation). Adds the
  `provisionType`/`infraEngine`/`serviceProvisioning`/`infraHandlerConfig` and
  custom-manifest-type contracts, a `provisioning` field on the service-frame `Block`
  (persisted as a JSON column on both runtimes and settable via the block update endpoint),
  and `provisionType`/`engine` fields on the environment handle. Introduces the per-user
  infra handler override table (`environment_user_handlers`, local-mode) and the workspace
  custom-manifest-type catalog (`custom_manifest_types`) — mirrored across D1 and Drizzle
  with a cross-runtime conformance suite — plus `provision_type`/`engine` columns on the
  `environments` registry. No behaviour is wired yet; the single→multi reshape of
  `environment_connections`, the resolver, and the UI follow in later slices. See
  `docs/initiatives/per-service-provision-types.md`.

### Minor Changes

- 2ac148d: Add a Docker Compose ephemeral-environment backend (the Checkbox-style preview-env mechanic).

  `composeEnvironmentBackend(runtime)` (new in `@cat-factory/integrations`) is an
  `EnvironmentProvider` that stands the PR repo's own `docker-compose.yml` up on a local Docker
  daemon under a per-PR `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, publishes the configured web service's port to an
  ephemeral host port, returns `http://localhost:<port>` for the Tester/`deployer` flow, and tears
  the project down on TTL. It rides the contract's generic environment-backend manifest member (no
  new config variant, no migration): the flat config lives in the stored manifest's `providerConfig`,
  written by the descriptor-driven connect form.

  To make the per-PR isolation real, the repo compose file is read checkout-free and **rewritten
  into one project file** before `up`: every service's published host port is forced ephemeral (so
  two concurrent per-PR stacks can't collide on a pinned host port — an additive `-f` overlay can't
  strip the base's mapping), the probed service is guaranteed to publish its port, and references
  this checkout-free backend can't honor — `build:` contexts, host bind mounts, relative `env_file`s,
  and `privileged` services — are **refused up front** with a clear reason instead of silently
  mis-mounting. An **auto-teardown TTL** is collected on the connect form (`ttlMinutes`, default
  2h; `0` = never) so a forgotten preview env is swept off the host instead of leaking containers +
  volumes. `testConnection` now probes the daemon (`compose ls`), not just the CLI, and every daemon
  call is time-bounded so a wedged daemon can't hang a provision/status/teardown. Default project
  names are disambiguated by block id so two workspaces sharing a repo name + PR number can't
  collide, and `status` reads `ps -a` so a brief container recreate doesn't flip a healthy env to
  `failed`.

  The local facade (`@cat-factory/local-server`) registers it by reference, closing over the host
  docker CLI, on the Docker-family runtimes only (Apple `container`, the plain Node service, and the
  Cloudflare Worker have no host docker daemon, so they don't register it — the documented
  runtime-bound asymmetry). The infrastructure picker (`@cat-factory/app`) surfaces it on the "Where
  test environments run" axis with actionable "when to use this" guidance and a local-only caveat.

  v1 supports self-contained image-based compose stacks (a service that builds from source, or that
  needs host bind mounts / relative env files, needs a full checkout — a follow-up). No
  backwards-compat concerns: this is a net-new opt-in backend.

### Minor Changes

- f9a173f: Fix three concurrency hazards in the backend with database-native primitives.

  - **Optimistic concurrency on execution runs.** `agent_runs` gains a monotonic `rev`
    column; the execution repo's `upsert` bumps it on every write and a new
    `compareAndSwap` performs a guarded conditional write. The in-place human-action handlers
    (resolve decision / request changes / reject / request-human-review-fix / resume-paused)
    now go through a `mutateInstance` retry helper, so a double-submit or a write that raced
    the durable driver is re-applied on fresh state instead of silently clobbering the other
    writer (lost update). (`retry` / `restart-from-step` mint a fresh run id, so the same-row
    hazard is structurally absent there.)
  - **Atomic API-key pool lease.** The non-transactional `listForPool → chooseToken →
markLeased` is replaced by a single atomic select-and-mark (`leaseLeastUsed`: Postgres
    `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; D1 a single serialised write), so two concurrent dispatches
    can no longer grab the same key before usage is recorded.
  - **Notification open-card dedup.** A partial unique index on
    `(workspace_id, block_id, type) WHERE status='open'` plus an atomic
    `upsertOpenForBlock` replaces the racy `findOpenByBlock` read-before-write, so two
    concurrent raises can't stack duplicate open cards. `upsertOpenForBlock` returns the
    CANONICAL persisted row, so when a concurrent raise wins the insert the loser delivers
    and returns that row's id rather than a phantom id (which would show a duplicate inbox
    card and 404 when acted on).

  BREAKING (pre-1.0, no data migration): `agent_runs` adds a non-null `rev` column and the
  `notifications` table adds a partial unique index, mirrored across the D1 and Drizzle
  migrations. The `ExecutionRepository`, `ProviderApiKeyRepository` and
  `NotificationRepository` ports each gain a method.

  repository methods, `ServiceRepository.listByFrameBlocks` and `AccountRepository.listByIds`
  (implemented symmetrically on the D1 and Drizzle stores, with cross-runtime conformance
  coverage). Behavior is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 21b2096: Make the environment-backend and runner-backend registries app-owned (DI) instead of
  module-global Maps. This is the pilot for the registry-DI migration
  (`docs/initiatives/registry-di-migration.md`): the composition root now constructs each
  registry instance via `createBackendRegistries()` and injects it through
  `CoreDependencies`; a deployment registers a custom backend by reference
  (`registry.register(provider)`), so registration no longer depends on the adapter and
  server sharing the same `@cat-factory/integrations` module instance.

  BREAKING (`@cat-factory/integrations`): the module-global free functions
  `registerEnvironmentBackend` / `environmentBackend` / `registeredEnvironmentBackendKinds`
  / `environmentBackendKinds` / `findRepairCapableProvider` and their runner-backend
  equivalents (`registerRunnerBackend` / `runnerBackend` / `registeredRunnerBackendKinds`
  / `runnerBackendKinds`) are removed. Use the new `EnvironmentBackendRegistry` /
  `RunnerBackendRegistry` classes (methods `register` / `get` / `kinds` / `labelled`, plus
  `findRepairCapable` on the env registry), the `defaultEnvironmentBackendRegistry()` /
  `defaultRunnerBackendRegistry()` factories, or the unified `createBackendRegistries()`.

### Minor Changes

- 4897078: Make the ephemeral-environment AND self-hosted runner-pool backend registries extensible to
  custom third-party kinds, so a single-tenant / self-hosted deployment can register a bespoke
  provider **programmatically** (an import side effect via `registerEnvironmentBackend` /
  `registerRunnerBackend`), mirroring custom agent kinds. This restores the capability the
  removed `buildNodeContainer({ environmentProvider })` / `startLocal({ environmentProvider })`
  deployment-wide injection used to provide, and serves both single- and multi-tenant.

  - **Contracts (breaking, additive):** `environmentBackendConfigSchema` /
    `runnerBackendConfigSchema` gain a generic custom-kind member (a lower-kebab `kind` slug,
    guarded to exclude the reserved built-ins, carrying the subsystem manifest body), so a
    custom kind's connect config validates with no new variant. The workspace snapshot gains
    `environmentBackendKinds` / `runnerBackendKinds`, and the describe routes accept an optional
    `kind` query. Existing `manifest`/`kubernetes` rows still parse — no migration.
  - **Registries:** `EnvironmentBackendProvider` / `RunnerBackendProvider` `kind` is now an open
    `string` with an optional `displayLabel`; new `environmentBackendKinds()` /
    `runnerBackendKinds()` accessors. `describeProvider(workspaceId, kind?)` can describe a
    registered kind before it is connected.
  - **Frontend:** the provider-connect backend-kind selector is snapshot-driven (built-in
    fallback) instead of a hardcoded `manifest`/`kubernetes` list; a custom kind's flat-form /
    manifest-editor save is tagged with its slug.
  - A custom kind requires a per-workspace connection (the encrypted-secret + `providerConfig`
    anchor) exactly like the built-ins. The `runnerPoolProvider` facade option is unchanged and
    remains the HTTP-pool override for the manifest backend, NOT the custom-kind seam.

### Patch Changes

- 614e985: Add real-cluster integration tests for the native Kubernetes runner + environment backends,
  and colocate all Kubernetes code under one module.

  The two Kubernetes adapters (`KubernetesRunnerTransport`, `KubernetesEnvironmentProvider`)
  were covered only by unit tests that stub `fetch` with hand-crafted responses, so the
  apiserver behaviours they depend on — the pod-proxy URL form, `404 → eviction`, server-side
  apply, namespace `409` idempotency, Deployment readiness, and the `status.loadBalancer` shape
  — were never validated against a real apiserver. A new integration suite (`*.it.spec.ts`, run
  via `pnpm --filter @cat-factory/integrations test:integration`) now drives both adapters
  against a real **k3d (k3s-in-Docker)** cluster, asserting the pod-proxy round-trip and the k3s
  ServiceLB-assigned URL for real. It self-skips when the `K8S_IT_*` cluster env is unset, and
  in CI runs as a blocking job gated behind a paths filter so the k3d cluster only spins up when
  Kubernetes code changes.

  That real-cluster suite caught a compatibility bug in the environment backend: its
  server-side apply sent the `application/apply-patch+json` media type, which only newer
  apiservers accept, so applying manifests `415`d on a stock/older cluster. It now sends
  `application/apply-patch+yaml` with the same JSON body (JSON is valid YAML), which every
  apiserver since 1.22 accepts — matching what kubectl/client-go do.

  The `kubernetesRunnerBackend` / `kubernetesEnvironmentBackend` registry entries moved into
  the `modules/kubernetes/` folder (the generic registries import them for side-effect
  registration); their exported names and the package's public surface are unchanged.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- 69558f9: Add a Kubernetes-based ephemeral-environment provider, selected per workspace through an
  env-backend registry that mirrors the runner-pool backends.

  The ephemeral-environment connection is now discriminated by a `kind` field (`manifest` =
  the generic BYO HTTP management API, `kubernetes` = native per-PR namespaces), resolved
  through a `registerEnvironmentBackend` provider-registry seam — so a native backend is a
  single registry entry + a config variant + a UI form, with no new table/service/controller.

  The Kubernetes backend applies an operator-authored set of k3s/Kubernetes manifests into a
  per-PR namespace over the kube-apiserver (server-side apply), reusing the Kubernetes runner
  backend's shared apiserver client (Bearer ServiceAccount token + custom-CA TLS). Manifests
  are read checkout-free from either the PR repo (co-located) or a separate repo; the URL is
  derived from an ingress host template or read back from an applied Service/Ingress
  LoadBalancer (k3s Traefik / ServiceLB). It is wired symmetrically into the Cloudflare and
  Node facades (the Worker rejects a custom-CA config it can't honor), and local mode can
  point at a developer-run local k3s (its env URL-safety policy is widened to loopback/LAN).
  See `backend/docs/local-k3s-environments.md`.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0):

  - The `environments/connection` register/test wire shape now takes a discriminated `config`
    instead of a bare `manifest`, and the `environment_connections` table gains a `kind`
    column (existing rows backfill to `manifest`).
  - The `EnvironmentProvider` provision request gains optional `runRepo` / `resolveRepoFiles`
    seams (additive).
  - The deployment-wide environment-provider injection option
    (`buildNodeContainer({ environmentProvider })` / `startLocal({ environmentProvider })`) is
    removed — native adapters register via `registerEnvironmentBackend` instead.

## 0.34.1

### Patch Changes

- 29d8b5d: Harness error handling & observability: structured failure cause, stuck-run diagnosis, and transient API retry.

  - **Structured failure cause.** The executor-harness now reports a structured `failureCause`
    (`inactivity-timeout` | `max-duration` | `agent` | `git` | `api` | `no-usable-output` |
    `no-changes`) and an extended `detail` on a failed job view, alongside the existing one-line
    `error`. The backend prefers the structured cause to classify a failure (→ `AgentFailureKind`
    / `BootstrapFailureKind`) and falls back to the existing error-string regex when it's absent
    (older image, or a manifest pool that doesn't map the cause), so the change is backward
    compatible. The fallback now matches the bootstrap path's regex on BOTH the agent and
    bootstrap paths (a watchdog timeout classifies as `timeout`, not a generic `agent`). A `git`
    operation or an upstream `api` call that fails carries its real cause rather than `agent`.
    The Node/self-hosted runner pool forwards the structured cause/detail too (new optional
    `failureCausePath`/`detailPath` on the pool response manifest), so it isn't Cloudflare-only.
    Container eviction stays facade-detected (the harness never emits the eviction marker). The
    watchdog phrases are centralized so they can't drift from the regex that still reads them.
  - **Stuck-run diagnosis.** An inactivity kill now reports which phase was hung and the last tool
    that ran (e.g. "...likely hung in agent phase; last tool bash 40s ago"), with a per-phase
    timing breakdown in `detail` and on the failure log. A per-job child logger binds the run's
    correlation fields (jobId/repo/branch/kind) onto every line.
  - **Transient API retry.** Opening a PR/MR now retries a transient upstream failure (5xx / 429 /
    network) with bounded, abort-aware exponential backoff (honoring `Retry-After`), so a momentary
    blip no longer fails an otherwise-complete run. The 422/409 "already exists" success paths are
    unaffected.
  - **Surfaced silent degradation.** Checkpoint-push failures, dropped follow-up lines, malformed
    Pi JSONL records, and SIGKILL escalation are now logged at warn with counts instead of being
    swallowed. A final non-newline-terminated Pi event is flushed so its progress/span isn't lost.

  Bumps the `@cat-factory/executor-harness` image to `1.22.0` (and the matching tag in
  `deploy/backend`).

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 40f687d: Surface container/environment spin-up breakages on the agent step instead of hanging or hiding them.

  - **Local Docker mode fails fast.** `LocalContainerRunnerTransport` now aborts the
    container start the moment the container has exited (or a CLI call fails) instead of
    spinning for the full ready timeout, and the thrown error carries the real Docker
    stderr plus a tail of the container's own logs — so a broken daemon / failed image
    pull / crashing entrypoint shows the root cause in the step's failure card and the
    provisioning-logs drawer within one poll rather than ~60s of "spinning up container".
    Adds a `logs()` method to the `ContainerRuntimeAdapter` seam (Docker + Apple adapters).

  - **Kubernetes runner fails fast on doomed pods.** `KubernetesRunnerTransport` now
    detects terminal container start-up reasons (`ImagePullBackOff`/`ErrImagePull`/
    `InvalidImageName`/`CreateContainerConfigError`/`CrashLoopBackOff`/…) and aborts the
    readiness wait immediately with the pod's real `reason: message` as a hard `dispatch`
    failure — instead of polling the full 120s and then mis-tagging a deterministic failure
    (e.g. a bad image) as a recoverable "evicted" that the engine re-drives into the same
    120s hang. The recoverable timeout/terminated paths are also enriched with the latest
    pod-status detail so a stuck pod is no longer a bare "not ready within 120000ms".

  - **Custom EnvironmentProvider failures are stored and displayed.** A failed `deployer`
    provision (the provider threw, or returned `status:'failed'`) is now a real, displayed
    step failure: the errored environment (with the provider's verbatim `lastError`) is
    persisted and stamped onto the step, and the run records a new `environment`
    `AgentFailureKind` — instead of a green step with the error buried in its prose output.
    A provider that reports `status:'failed'` WITHOUT throwing can now carry its verbatim
    reason on the new optional `ProvisionedEnvironment.error` field (`@cat-factory/kernel`),
    which surfaces as the step's `lastError` instead of a generic "Provisioning failed". The
    failure is terminal + surfaced for one-click retry (NOT auto-retried), deliberately
    symmetric with the `dispatch` (container-failed-to-start) failure.

  **Breaking shape change:** `agentFailureKindSchema` gains the `environment` member.

### Minor Changes

- e0f1149: Design-context sources: add Zeplin, generalize the abstraction, drop the Claude Design backend connector.

  - **New source: Zeplin** (`source='zeplin'`, per-workspace Bearer PAT) — a real server-fetchable
    REST handoff source exposing screens, components and design tokens. On by default; a no-op until a
    workspace connects it.
  - **De-Figma-shaped abstraction:** Figma and Zeplin now map into a shared, source-neutral
    `DesignContext` model rendered by `renderDesignContext` (`integrations/documents/design.logic.ts`).
    The per-source prompt fragments collapse into a single `design.context` fragment.
  - **Breaking — Claude Design backend connector removed.** Its only real read path is login-bound
    (Claude Code's `DesignSync` / `/design-sync`, via the user's claude.ai login), so a headless
    multi-tenant backend can never authenticate. The provider, the `'claude-design'` source value, the
    descriptor `credentialScope` field, and the entire per-user `user_document_connections` store
    (D1 + Drizzle tables, repositories, kernel ports, scope-aware `DocumentConnectionService`) are
    removed — all document sources are workspace-scoped again. The supported Claude Design workflow is
    now: `/design-sync` into the repo → commit → agents read it as checkout files. Stale
    `user_document_connections` rows are dropped (D1 migration `0020`, Drizzle drop migration); per the
    pre-1.0 policy there is no data migration.

### Minor Changes

- fc324d2: Add Kubernetes support for executor containers via a universal "agent runner backend"
  abstraction.

  The self-hosted runner pool is generalized into a discriminated runner-backend
  connection (a new `kind` field): `manifest` (the existing BYO HTTP scheduler pool) and
  `kubernetes` (new), with a `registerRunnerBackend` provider-registry seam so future
  backends (Nomad, EKS, …) are a single registry entry + a config variant + a UI form — no
  new table, service, controller, or integration window.

  The Kubernetes backend (`KubernetesRunnerTransport`, target k8s 1.35+) runs one bare Pod
  per run and reaches the per-pod executor-harness through the kube-apiserver **pod-proxy
  subresource** (Bearer ServiceAccount token), so the orchestrator needs only HTTPS to the
  apiserver — no in-cluster networking or per-run Service — and full `RunnerJobView`
  fidelity is preserved with zero executor-harness changes. It is wired symmetrically into
  both the Cloudflare and Node facades (and local mode via Node), and surfaced in the
  existing runner-backend Integrations window via a backend-type selector.

  BREAKING (pre-1.0): the `runner-pool/connection` register/test wire shape now takes a
  discriminated `config` instead of a bare `manifest`, and the `runner_pool_connections`
  table gains a `kind` column (existing rows backfill to `manifest`). The
  `executor-harness` image is unchanged (no image/tag bump).

### Minor Changes

- e3b3540: feat(environments): durable, asynchronous environment-provider config-repair agent

  When mechanical config bootstrap can't produce a valid provider config (`needsAgent`, or the
  re-validation still fails) and the caller passed `allowAgentFallback`, the engine dispatches a
  coding agent that fixes the provider's config file in an existing repo and pushes the fix back.
  That repair is now a **durable, asynchronous, observable run** — modelled exactly on the
  "bootstrap repo" flow — instead of being awaited synchronously inside the `bootstrapRepo` HTTP
  request (a ~20-minute in-request poll loop that could not survive on the Cloudflare Worker).

  - The repair is its own `kind='env-config-repair'` run in the unified `agent_runs` table (no DB
    migration — the table is kind-scoped), driven durably by **Cloudflare Workflows**
    (`EnvConfigRepairWorkflow`) ⇄ **Node pg-boss** (`env-config-repair.advance` queue), and
    re-driven by the existing cron / stale-run sweeper on either runtime. Local mode inherits the
    pg-boss driver via `buildNodeContainer`.
  - `ContainerEnvConfigRepairer` (`@cat-factory/server`) is reworked into the kernel
    `EnvConfigRepairer` port (`startRepair`/`pollRepair`/`stopRepair`) — dispatch returns
    immediately; the durable runner polls. It still dispatches a plain `coding` job (no `bootstrap`
    block, no PR, no force-push), distinct from the repo-bootstrap flow.
  - `bootstrapRepo` now **starts** the repair run and returns immediately with `usedAgent:true`,
    `repairJobId`, and `ok:false` (pending); the new `EnvConfigRepairService` re-validates the repo
    on completion (via a callback into `EnvironmentConnectionService`, where the decrypted secrets +
    manifest config live) and records the terminal `ok`/`issues`. In PR mode the fix is targeted at
    the config PR branch, not the target branch.
  - The run is observable: progress/outcome is pushed as an `env-config-repair` workspace event and
    carried on the workspace snapshot (`envConfigRepairJobs`); the SPA holds it in the agentRuns
    store and rides the unified `agent-runs` retry/stop endpoints (the new kind supports both —
    retry re-starts a fresh run from the failed job's coords). There is no board block — a repair is
    surfaced only on the infrastructure-providers surface that triggered it.
  - Wired symmetrically across the Cloudflare, Node and local facades, with a cross-runtime
    conformance assertion (`driveEnvConfigRepair` + a fake `EnvConfigRepairer`) that drives a repair
    to `succeeded` with the post-repair validation recorded on both D1 and Postgres. Gated on the
    container prerequisites plus a provider that supports `describeRepairAgent`, so a stock
    deployment running the generic manifest provider is unchanged.
  - The original bootstrap `inputs` (which shape the repair agent's prompt) are persisted on the
    run record (internal, never on the wire), so a retry re-dispatches a fresh run with the SAME
    prompt context via `EnvConfigRepairService.retry` instead of dropping them.

  Breaking (pre-1.0, no migration): the `dispatchConfigRepair` /
  `CoreDependencies.dispatchEnvConfigRepair` seam is replaced by the `EnvConfigRepairer` /
  `EnvConfigRepairRunner` / `EnvConfigRepairJobRepository` ports + `Core.envConfigRepair`; any
  in-flight synchronous repair shape is obsolete.

### Minor Changes

- 704c99e: Fill the gaps in Linear support:

  - **Connection pagination**: the Linear task source now walks the `children` and
    `comments` GraphQL connection cursors, so an epic with more than one page of
    sub-issues imports its full child set (no longer silently capped at ~50) — matching
    the Jira provider's epic-children pagination.
  - **Team picker for ticket filing**: a new `GET /workspaces/:ws/task-sources/linear/teams`
    endpoint lists the connected workspace's Linear teams, and the issue-tracker settings
    UI offers a searchable (typeahead) team picker instead of requiring a hand-pasted team
    UUID.
  - **OAuth connect flow**: Linear can now be connected via OAuth ("Connect with Linear")
    in addition to a personal API key. The OAuth app credentials (client id / secret /
    redirect URL) are configured **per account in the UI** (account Deployment settings,
    sealed in the DB and resolved dynamically — mirroring the Slack OAuth model), NOT via
    env vars, so an admin can set/rotate them without a redeploy. Absent ⇒ only the manual
    API-key path is offered. The exchanged access token is stored as the connection and
    used as a `Bearer` token across import, search, ticket filing and PR writeback.
  - **Search exact-ref match**: pasting a Linear issue identifier or URL into search now
    resolves and surfaces that exact issue first (de-duped against the term hits), like the
    GitHub Issues source.

- 3d0b85c: feat(environments): wire the live environment-provider config-repair agent (PR #416 increment 2)

  When mechanical config bootstrap can't produce a valid provider config (`needsAgent`, or the
  post-commit re-validation still fails) and the caller passed `allowAgentFallback`, the engine now
  dispatches a coding agent that clones the target repo at the write branch, fixes the provider's
  config file in place, and pushes the fix back onto the same branch — then `EnvironmentConnectionService`
  re-validates.

  - New `ContainerEnvConfigRepairer` (`@cat-factory/server`) dispatches a plain `coding` job via the
    shared `RunnerJobClient`/`RunnerTransport` (no `bootstrap` block, no PR) and awaits it. It is
    distinct from the repo-bootstrap flow — it never reinitialises history or force-pushes.
  - The `dispatchConfigRepair` / `CoreDependencies.dispatchEnvConfigRepair` seam now returns `void`
    (it only pushes the fix); re-validation moved into `EnvironmentConnectionService`, where the
    decrypted secrets + manifest config live.
  - Wired symmetrically across the Cloudflare and Node facades (local inherits via `buildNodeContainer`),
    gated on the container prerequisites plus an injected provider that supports `describeRepairAgent`,
    so a stock deployment running the generic manifest provider is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 4b5d267: Environment provider repo-config lifecycle: validate + bootstrap (+ agent-repair seam)

  Adds optional `EnvironmentProvider` capabilities so a native adapter (e.g. a future Kargo
  adapter) can manage its config file inside the deployed repo:

  - `validateRepo` — mechanical repo-config validation, run on-demand
    (`POST /environments/connection/validate-repo`) and as a provision pre-flight gate that
    fails synchronously before `provider.provision()` instead of as an async failed environment.
  - `describeBootstrapInputs` + `bootstrapProviderConfiguration` — mechanically generate the
    config file from UI-collected variables; the engine commits it (idempotent; optional PR) and
    re-validates (`POST /environments/connection/bootstrap-repo`).
  - `describeRepairAgent` — agent-repair prompt + dispatch seam (the live engine dispatch is
    scaffolded but not yet wired; see `backend/docs/env-lifecycle.md`).

  All repo I/O flows through the existing VCS-neutral `RepoFiles` abstraction, so the provider
  never sees a VCS host or token (GitHub today, GitLab later). The provider descriptor now
  carries `supportsRepoValidation` / `supportsRepoBootstrap` / `bootstrapInputs`. The generic
  `HttpEnvironmentProvider` implements none of these, so manifest-driven providers are unchanged.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 8727f2b: Filesystem blob backend + UI-managed, per-account content storage.

  - New `FilesystemBinaryBlobBackend` (Node/local) stores binary artifacts (UI-tester
    screenshots, reference designs) on disk under a base path (default `.file-storage`,
    git-ignored). Added `'fs'` to `BinaryArtifactStorageKind`.
  - Content-storage configuration moves entirely into the UI, scoped per **account**
    (Account → Deployment settings), stored in `account_settings` (no DB migration; the
    S3 access keys are sealed in the existing secrets blob). The blob backend is now
    resolved per request/run from the account's settings via the new
    `makeResolveBinaryArtifactStore` seam (`@cat-factory/server`), replacing the static
    `binaryArtifactStore` on the container with a `resolveBinaryArtifactStore(workspaceId)`.
  - Available backends per runtime: **Node/local** offer `fs` / `s3` / `db`, **Cloudflare**
    offers `r2` only (S3 is deliberately not offered on the Worker — the AWS SDK does not belong
    in the Worker bundle). Defaults when an account hasn't configured storage: **local** defaults
    to the filesystem backend (works out of the box); **Node** defaults to off (storage requires
    explicit configuration); **Cloudflare** defaults to its R2 bucket.

  BREAKING: the env-var content-storage configuration is removed — `BINARY_STORAGE_BACKEND`,
  `S3_ARTIFACT_*`, and `AppConfig.binaryStorage`/`BinaryStorageConfig` no longer exist.
  Configure storage per-account in the UI instead. Switching an account's backend orphans its
  previously-stored artifacts (no migration of existing bytes), which is acceptable pre-1.0.

## 0.26.5

### Patch Changes

- 8fad695: Update dependencies to latest.

  - `undici` 7→8 (test-only `MockAgent`). undici's MockAgent must match Node's
    bundled undici to intercept the global `fetch`; Node 26 bundles undici 8.5.0,
    so the test runner / CI is pinned to **Node 26**. Production runtime is
    unaffected — `undici` is a dev/test dependency only, and the service still runs
    on any Node >=20 (e.g. the example `deploy/node` image stays on Node 24).
  - Minor/patch bumps: `wrangler` 4.105, `@cloudflare/*`, `@types/node` 26.0.1,
    `vue` 3.5.39, `msw` 2.14.6, `valibot` 1.4.2, `workers-ai-provider` 3.2.1,
    `@toad-contracts/*` (core 0.4.0, valibot 0.5.0, hono/testing/http-client 0.3.2),
    `@aws-sdk/client-s3` 3.1075.
  - The AI SDK (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/*`) is intentionally held at v6 / v3-v4: the latest
    `workers-ai-provider` (3.2.1, the Cloudflare Workers AI provider) still peers on
    `ai@^6` / `@ai-sdk/provider@^3` and is not yet compatible with `ai` v7.
  - Pinned the whole Vue runtime family to one version via a pnpm `override`
    (`vue` + `@vue/*` → 3.5.39). Bumping `vue` to 3.5.39 left Nuxt 4.4.8's
    transitive deps pinning parts of the graph to 3.5.38, so two copies of Vue were
    bundled into the SPA; Vue's render internals are module-level singletons, so the
    second copy crashed the app on boot (`Cannot read properties of null (reading
'ce')` in `renderSlot`) — a blank 500 page that hung the whole e2e suite. One
    version = one singleton.
  - GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` v6→v7, `pnpm/action-setup` v6.0.9,
    `zizmorcore/zizmor-action` v0.5.7, `changesets/action` pinned to v1.9.0. CI Node 24→26.

  (this is what happened to `@cat-factory/gitlab` and `@cat-factory/provider-s3`). The hook
  removes that footgun for every publishable library.

### Minor Changes

- eab73b8: feat(documents): add Claude Design as a per-user design-context document source

  Implements the Claude Design half of the design record in
  `backend/docs/figma-claude-design-context.md`. Claude Design becomes a new
  `DocumentSourceProvider` (`source='claude-design'`) that reuses the whole documents
  integration (link plumbing, controller, `.cat-context/` materialization, prompt
  fragment), with a deterministic design-system normalizer that turns a project's
  `_ds_manifest.json` / `@dsCard`-marked component HTML + CSS custom properties into the
  same `### Components` / `### Design tokens` Markdown shape the Figma provider emits — so
  it earns its place over a plain HTML upload.

  Auth is a **personal per-user PAT**, supported on every runtime: a new descriptor flag
  `credentialScope: 'user'` routes such a source to a new per-user
  `user_document_connections` store (D1 ⇄ Drizzle, encrypted at rest under a distinct HKDF
  info), keyed by the acting user and never shared with the workspace. `DocumentConnectionService`
  becomes scope-aware; the import path threads the acting user. Workspace-scoped sources
  (Notion/Confluence/GitHub/Figma/Linear) are unchanged. The acting user falls back to the
  empty user id ONLY when auth is disabled (dev-open / single-user local mode) so those
  deployments still connect; when auth is enabled the controller fails closed with a 401
  rather than silently using the shared empty-user bucket.

  Claude Design is **opt-in**, not on by default: its credentialed project-read API is
  still provisional (the read is claude.ai-login-bound, no per-user service token yet), so
  it is excluded from the default `DOCUMENT_SOURCES` set and must be enabled explicitly
  (`DOCUMENT_SOURCES=…,claude-design`) once the API is real — every other source stays on
  by default.

  Also hoists the host-pinned `safeFetch`/SSRF guard/capped-read into a shared
  `documents/http.ts` reused by Figma and Claude Design. Wired symmetrically into both
  facades and gated by a new cross-runtime conformance case (per-user connect → list →
  disconnect).

- eab73b8: feat(documents): add Figma as a design-context document source

  Implements the Figma half of the design record in
  `backend/docs/figma-claude-design-context.md`. Figma becomes a new
  `DocumentSourceProvider` (`source='figma'`) authenticated by a per-workspace
  personal access token, reusing the whole documents integration (connection table,
  sealing, link plumbing, controller, `.cat-context/` materialization). `fetchDocument`
  renders a frame/file's layout tree, text, components-used and (Enterprise-gated)
  design tokens to Markdown, with a best-effort rendered-preview URL on a reference
  line. Wired symmetrically into both the Cloudflare and Node facades (and the
  `DOCUMENT_SOURCES` allow-list), gated by a cross-runtime conformance case. Adds the
  `design.figma-context` prompt fragment for frontend agents. (Claude Design ships in a
  companion changeset.)

  Also makes a URL pasted into a block description auto-match its imported document by the
  document's stable `(source, externalId)` — canonicalised through the providers'
  `parseRef` (`AgentContextBuilder.documentUrlResolver`) — instead of by exact URL-string
  equality, which silently failed for a real Figma share link (title path segment, dash
  node id, `&t=` tracking params) whose canonical stored `url` omits that noise.

  pipeline step can file issues into Linear; and PR writeback comments on and

  later. Adds one nullable `linear_team_id` column to `tracker_settings` (mirrored
  across D1 and Postgres) for the team new issues are filed under.

### Minor Changes

- 32c653f: Add the Visual Confirmation gate and split the tester into an API + UI tester.

  - **Tester split:** the `tester` kind is renamed to `tester-api` (general/API exploratory
    testing) and a new `tester-ui` kind drives a real browser (Playwright), captures a
    non-redundant screenshot of each distinct view, uploads them to the binary-artifact
    store, and reports them under `TestReport.screenshots[]`. Both share the Tester→Fixer
    loop and the `tester.environment` infra choice (`isTesterKind`). The UI tester dispatches
    with `image:'ui'` so a transport can route it to a dedicated Playwright/browser image.
  - **Visual Confirmation gate** (`visual-confirmation`): a park-on-decision engine gate
    (modelled on `human-test`) that gathers the UI tester's screenshots + the human-uploaded
    reference design images (paired by view) and parks for a person to review actual-vs-reference.
    The human approves (advance), requests a fix (dispatches the Tester's `fixer`, then re-parks),
    or recaptures. Raises a `visual_confirmation_ready` notification; passes through when no
    binary-artifact store is wired. New `pl_visual` pipeline (`… tester-ui → visual-confirmation
→ merger`) and the `GET /blocks/:id/artifacts` + visual-confirmation action endpoints.
  - Cross-runtime conformance covers the gate's no-store pass-through and the artifact store's
    `listByBlock`.

  BREAKING: the `tester` agent kind is renamed to `tester-api`. Per this repo's pre-1.0 policy
  (no backwards-compatibility shims), any persisted state that still names `tester` simply stops
  matching: a saved/custom pipeline referencing `tester` is detected as outdated and reseeded from
  the catalog, and an execution that is parked mid-`tester` at upgrade time will no longer be
  recognised by the tester gate (re-run the task). New runs are unaffected — the seeded pipelines
  all use `tester-api`.

  NOTE: the dedicated UI-tester container image (Playwright/Chromium) and the per-kind image
  routing into it (a second Cloudflare container class; image-per-step on the local/pool
  transports) are a deploy-time follow-up — the `image:'ui'` dispatch seam is in place. Until that
  routing AND the harness env-passthrough (`ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_URL`/`ARTIFACT_UPLOAD_TOKEN` + a
  Playwright driver) land, `tester-ui` has no browser and the `pl_visual` gate runs in MANUAL mode
  (a human uploads references + screenshots and reviews them), which is why `pl_visual` is flagged
  `experimental`.

### Minor Changes

- 76543fa: Add a **Human Review gate** — an opt-in pipeline step (`human-review`, pipeline `pl_pr_review`
  "Build & PR review") that watches a task's PR for a human code review on GitHub and loops the
  existing `fixer` agent to address feedback:

  - Advances once the PR meets GitHub's required approvals (read from branch protection) with no
    unresolved review threads.
  - Dispatches the `fixer` to address outstanding review threads (immediately when approved; after a
    per-task grace window otherwise), then resolves each handed thread on GitHub via the GraphQL
    review-thread API so the next probe sees it cleared. A reviewer re-opening a thread re-triggers a fix.
  - Waits indefinitely for the human (re-arming, never auto-failing), surfacing a `human_review`
    notification while it waits.
  - A human can request a freeform fix at any time from the gate window
    (`POST /workspaces/:ws/blocks/:blockId/human-review/request-fix`), dispatched immediately.

  Built as a registry gate in `@cat-factory/gates` (new `PullRequestReviewProvider` port +
  `GitHubPullRequestReviewProvider`, wired in every facade) reusing the generic gate driver, plus
  small generic engine seams: `pollExhaustion: 'rearm'`, a `GateDefinition.onHelperComplete` side-effect
  hook, and a `pendingFix` manual-inject path. Adds a per-task `humanReviewGraceMinutes` merge-preset
  knob (D1 ⇄ Drizzle migration). The cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the gate on every runtime.

  Review hardening:

  - Branch-protection's required-approval count is read against the PR's **actual base branch**
    (`pulls/{n}.base.ref`), not the repo default — so a PR into a stricter protected branch is gated
    against its own rule instead of silently defaulting to 1.
  - A **stalled fixer** (no progress on an unchanged head while feedback is outstanding) now raises a
    `human_review` notification instead of waiting silently/invisibly forever.
  - The awaiting-approval `human_review` card carries the run's `executionId`, so the inbox deep-links
    into the gate window (the "request a fix here" affordance) instead of merely selecting the block.
  - The thread-resolve reconcile is scoped strictly to threads the gate itself handed the fixer
    (retained until confirmed resolved) — a **third-party review bot's** open thread is never silently
    closed, and its feedback isn't mistaken for the fixer's own.
  - `requestHumanReviewFix` rejects (409) when the gate has no review provider / async executor wired,
    instead of accepting a request it would silently drop.
  - The static branch-protection read is cached on the gate state after the first probe, so an
    indefinite wait no longer re-reads it every poll.

  **Breaking:** `FIXER_AGENT_KIND` moved from `@cat-factory/orchestration`'s `ci.logic` to
  `@cat-factory/kernel` (re-exported from `ci.logic` for existing call sites); the `merge_threshold_presets`
  table gains a non-null `human_review_grace_minutes` column.

### Minor Changes

- 17adf4c: Local mode: warm container pool + checkout reuse, and optional native (host-process)
  execution of the developer's installed Claude Code / Codex CLI.

  **Warm pool + persistent checkout (default off = unchanged):** the local runner transport
  can keep idle harness containers warm and lease one — preferring a member that already holds
  the run's repo — instead of cold-starting a container per run. A leased member reuses a
  stable per-repo checkout (`git reset --hard` + a keep-list clean sweep that preserves
  dependency caches like `node_modules`, then `fetch` + switch branch) rather than cloning from
  scratch. New harness job field `persistentCheckout` drives this; it is set only by the local
  pool transport, so every other runtime keeps the ephemeral fresh-clone path byte-for-byte.
  Pooling is Docker-family only (the new `capabilities.pooling`); Apple `container` keeps the
  per-run path.

  **Configured in the UI + DB, not env:** the warm-pool sizing (size / pre-warm / max / idle
  timeout) and the per-repo checkout-reuse knobs (workspace root + dep-cache keep list) are a
  new per-deployment singleton (`local_settings`, Postgres/Drizzle only — local-mode-only, so
  no D1 mirror) exposed through a dedicated **"Local mode"** settings panel
  (Integrations → Local mode), served by a new `GET|PUT /local-settings` controller wired only
  on the local facade (503 elsewhere). This REPLACES the env vars `LOCAL_POOL_SIZE`,
  `LOCAL_POOL_MIN_WARM`, `LOCAL_POOL_MAX`, `LOCAL_POOL_IDLE_TTL_MS`, `HARNESS_WORKSPACE_ROOT`,
  `HARNESS_CLEAN_KEEP` (no longer read). The container transport forwards the checkout knobs to
  the harness container as `HARNESS_*` env. Breaking: those env vars are dropped — set the
  values in the UI instead.

  **Native execution (`LOCAL_NATIVE_AGENTS`, default off):** an allow-list of subscription
  harnesses (`claude-code,codex`) to run as a host process (new `LocalProcessRunnerTransport`)
  driving the developer's OWN installed `claude` / `codex` CLI with its ambient login (new
  harness `ambientAuth` mode) — no leased credential, no personal-credential gate for those
  vendors. Native applies ONLY to a listed harness's NATIVE vendor (Anthropic `claude` /
  OpenAI `codex`): a non-native vendor that reuses the `claude-code` harness (GLM/Kimi/DeepSeek
  carries its own base URL) and proxy/`pi` models are NOT run unsandboxed on the host — they
  keep the sandboxed per-run container path (so they still lease their real credential and
  still need `LOCAL_HARNESS_IMAGE`). Gated, local-facade-only, with the explicit no-sandbox /
  own-subscription trade documented. Requires `LOCAL_HARNESS_ENTRY`. The Tester's local
  docker-compose infra is reported unsupported in native mode for now (host-compose +
  git-worktree isolation are a follow-up phase).

  Breaking: none (all paths default off). The executor-harness image is bumped (1.16.0) for
  the new `persistentCheckout` / `ambientAuth` handling.

### Patch Changes

- 81b60d4: Add the future-looking **Follow-up companion** to the Coder agent.

  As the Coder works it now surfaces forward-looking items — genuine loose ends, useful
  side-tasks it is deliberately not acting on, and clarifying questions — by appending them
  to a `.cat-follow-ups.jsonl` sentinel file in its working directory. The executor-harness
  tails that file and streams the items **out** on the job view (drain-on-read, like tool
  spans), so a blinking **Follow-up companion** chip on the Coder step lights up the moment
  the first item appears — while the container is still running.

  A human triages each item at any point: file a follow-up as a tracker issue (GitHub Issues
  / Jira, via the existing `TicketTrackerProvider`), send it back to the Coder to address
  after delivering the key task, answer a question, or dismiss it. The pipeline's following
  steps do not start until **every** item is decided: an undecided follow-up or unanswered
  question parks the run at the Coder's completion (a new `followup_pending` notification).
  Once all are decided the engine loops the Coder for the queued / answered items (within a
  per-step budget) before advancing. The companion is enabled by default on Coder steps and
  disableable per step in the pipeline builder.

  This is pure engine + run-step state (no new table) so it is runtime-symmetric across the
  Cloudflare and Node facades — the cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the park →
  decide → loop → advance behaviour on both. Wire contracts (`followUpItem` /
  `followUpsStepState`, the `followup_pending` notification, the `follow-ups` result view),
  the `streamFollowUps` harness job flag + `RunnerJobView.followUps` channel (with an
  optional pool-manifest `followUpsPath`), and the `FOLLOW_UP_GUIDANCE` Coder prompt fragment
  are added across the stack.

  Bumps the executor-harness image (new src) — publish + redeploy to roll it out.

### Patch Changes

- 18f6b3b: Security hardening across three surfaces.

  Local-runner SSRF: the server-side fetches to a user-supplied runner base URL (the "Test
  connection" probe and the run-time LLM proxy forward) now follow redirects manually and
  re-validate every hop against the loopback/LAN allow-list, so a reachable runner can no
  longer `302` the server into the cloud-metadata endpoint or a public host. `localRunnerUrlError`
  also rejects URLs with embedded credentials. New `fetchLocalRunner` helper in
  `@cat-factory/integrations`.

  Harness inbound auth: the Cloudflare container transport now sends the `x-harness-secret`
  header and injects `HARNESS_SHARED_SECRET` into each per-run container's env when the secret
  is configured, matching the harness server and the local Docker transport. Unset leaves the
  harness open as before (it is only reachable via DO-internal addressing). The self-hosted
  runner pool reaches the harness through its own control plane, so its secret is configured
  pool-side.

  GitHub API requests in the executor harness now build the PR-lookup query with
  `URLSearchParams` and encode the owner/name path segments, so a branch or owner containing
  `&`/`#` can't split the query or inject a parameter.

### Minor Changes

- a639189: Observability for ephemeral-environment and container provisioning.

  - **Unified provisioning event log.** A new append-only log records every attempt to
    spin up / tear down throwaway infrastructure — ephemeral environments
    (provision/teardown/status) and the runner-pool / per-run containers
    (dispatch/release/poll-failure) — with the outcome and the verbatim provider/runtime
    error on failure. Surfaced via `GET /workspaces/:ws/provisioning-logs` and a "View
    logs" button in the ephemeral-environment provider and self-hosted runner-pool config
    panels.
  - **Env lifecycle in run details.** An agent run's step now carries the ephemeral
    environment it runs against (spinning up / running / shut down / errored + URL/expiry
    - exact error), shown in the step detail (notably for the Tester).
  - **Container-start failures.** When a container/runner never accepts the job, the run
    details now say "Container failed to start" and show the exact provider/runtime error
    (a `dispatch`-kind failure) instead of a generic "Run failed". A run's step detail also
    has an "Infrastructure attempts" drawer (filtered by execution id) that surfaces that
    run's container/runner/env spin-up + tear-down attempts.
  - **Secret redaction.** The verbatim provider/runtime error and structured detail are
    scrubbed at the single recorder choke point before they are persisted/served — bearer
    tokens, `Authorization`/`x-api-key` header echoes, credentialed URLs, and recognisable
    token shapes (`sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA`/JWT) are replaced with `[REDACTED]` while the
    surrounding context (field name, URL host, token scheme) is kept for diagnosis.

  **Breaking / operational:** the provisioning log lives in a PHYSICALLY SEPARATE store to
  isolate its high write churn. The Cloudflare Worker needs a new `PROVISIONING_DB` D1
  binding (its own `migrations-provisioning` dir — create the database and apply its
  migrations); when absent, the feature is simply off. The Node service uses a dedicated
  `provisioning` Postgres schema, created with `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` by `migrate()`
  on boot (the DB role needs `CREATE` on the database — the same privilege the app already
  uses to create its `public` tables). Retention is governed by `PROVISIONING_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`
  (default 14). Catching a container dispatch error at the dispatch site means a transient
  dispatch blip is now a terminal `dispatch` failure (retry from the failure card) rather
  than relying on a Workflows step retry.

### Minor Changes

- 69d2270: Surface the Sandbox (the parallel prompt/model testing surface) end to end. Previously
  only the domain logic (`@cat-factory/sandbox`), wire contracts and kernel ports existed,
  with no way to use the feature; this wires the full stack:

  - **Services** (`@cat-factory/orchestration`): `SandboxService` (prompt-version lineage,
    fixture library with lazy builtin seeding, experiment definitions) + `SandboxRunService`
    (the run-driver + judge — expands an experiment matrix into cells, runs each inline
    candidate against the prompt-version's system text + the fixture input, grades it with a
    judge model against the task rubric, and records the deterministic objective findings
    score). Assembled as the `sandbox` core module when its repositories are wired.
  - **HTTP API** (`@cat-factory/server`): `SandboxController` mounts the prompt/fixture/
    experiment CRUD + `POST /sandbox/experiments/:id/launch`. 503 when unconfigured.
  - **Persistence**: the Sandbox gets its **own database** per runtime for blast-radius
    isolation — a dedicated `SANDBOX_DB` D1 database on the Cloudflare Worker (its own
    `sandbox-migrations/` lineage) and a dedicated `sandbox` Postgres schema on Node
    (Drizzle). Both runtimes contribute the repositories via a single sandbox-owned
    `Partial<CoreDependencies>` mixin, so neither facade enumerates them. Cross-runtime
    conformance asserts parity.
  - **Frontend** (`@cat-factory/app`): a Sandbox window (opened from the sidebar +
    command palette) to clone/version prompts, browse graded fixtures, and define + run
    experiments with a scored results grid.

  BREAKING (deployment): the Cloudflare Worker reads an optional new `SANDBOX_DB` binding;
  without it the Sandbox API answers 503 (the rest of the product is unaffected). To enable
  it, provision a second D1 database and point the binding + its `migrations_dir` at the
  package's `sandbox-migrations/` (see `deploy/backend/wrangler.toml`). On Node the
  `sandbox` schema is created automatically by the boot migrator.

  Container/repo fixtures (a real checkout) are not yet supported by the in-product run
  driver and are refused at launch; the builtin fixtures are all inline.

  Run-driver hardening: a relaunch clears the prior result grid first (new
  `SandboxRunRepository`/`SandboxGradeRepository.removeByExperiment`, mirrored on D1 +
  Drizzle) instead of accumulating duplicate cells; the experiment's terminal status is
  derived from whether any cell was actually graded (`failed` when every candidate failed OR
  every grade failed — never a misleading `done` over a grid of unscored cells, and never
  left `running`); the token budget must be ≥ 1 (a `0` budget is rejected at create rather
  than silently failing every cell) and is documented as a soft cap enforced between cells;
  the judge model defaults to the deployment routing default (no hardcoded vendor) and
  requires an explicit `judgeModel` when none is configured (the experiment builder now
  exposes a judge-model picker so a deployment with no default still has recourse); an
  unparseable / empty / reasoning-only judge reply is now recorded as a grading **error** on
  the cell rather than silently flooring every dimension to the minimum (which read as a
  confident bottom-of-scale grade); the judge-reply JSON extractor — now the single robust
  `extractJson` promoted to `@cat-factory/kernel` and shared by the requirements reviewer, the
  document planner and the Sandbox judge (replacing two weaker object-only copies) — is
  string-literal aware, scans forward past any leading bracket whose span isn't valid JSON
  (so prose like `I weighed [the auth flow]: {…}` no longer defeats extraction for the
  object-returning reviewers), and falls back past a leading non-JSON code fence. The judge
  prompt appends the shared `FINAL_ANSWER_IN_REPLY` directive like the other parsed-reply
  agents, and the provider-for-scope resolution the Sandbox shares with the reviewers is now
  one `resolveScopedModelProvider` kernel helper instead of two copies. The Sandbox window now surfaces a
  non-503 load failure (with a retry) instead of rendering an empty, healthy-looking panel.
  The fixture↔kind mapping the UI filters by now lives on the `@cat-factory/sandbox` catalog
  (`SandboxAgentKindMeta.fixtureKinds`) instead of a parallel frontend switch. Concurrent
  launches of the same experiment are now serialised by an atomic
  `SandboxExperimentRepository.claimForRun` (a conditional transition to `running`, mirrored on
  D1 + Drizzle): only the winner clears + re-expands the result grid, so two simultaneous
  launches can't duplicate the grid or race the grid-clearing deletes, and the grid setup runs
  inside the terminal-status `finally` so a failure there can't strand the experiment
  `running`. The matrix cell cap is surfaced on the overview (`maxCells`) so the builder gates
  on the SAME limit instead of re-encoding the literal. NOTE: the run-driver still executes the
  matrix inline in the launch request (bounded by the cell cap + token budget); a durable
  fan-out (Workflows / pg-boss) for large matrices remains a follow-up.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 3546e3d: Move operator/integration config out of environment variables into encrypted, UI-editable
  DB settings. DB is now the source of truth — the moved env vars are **removed** (no
  fallback), so the listed vars below no longer have any effect.

  **Per-workspace budget (Workspace settings → Budget).** A workspace's spend currency,
  monthly limit, and per-model price overrides now live on the `workspace_settings` row.
  The spend safeguard resolves each workspace's effective pricing (base table + overrides)
  behind a short-TTL cache, scoping the budget gate to the workspace's own usage
  (`SpendService.status`/`isOverBudget` now take a `workspaceId`; new
  `TokenUsageRepository.totalsSinceForWorkspace`). **Behaviour change:** spend is metered +
  gated per workspace, not deployment-wide; a workspace with no budget inherits the built-in
  default (~100 EUR/month). Removes env: `SPEND_MONTHLY_LIMIT`, `SPEND_CURRENCY`,
  `SPEND_MODEL_PRICES`. A budget of `0` is intentional ("no PAID spend"): metered runs are
  refused **up front** at start/retry with a clear `409` (not just a silent mid-run pause),
  while LOCAL-runner models (keyless) and connected SUBSCRIPTIONS (flat-rate quota) keep
  running since they incur no metered cost — so `0` is the "local-/subscription-only" setting.
  The over-budget exemption (previously subscription-only) now also covers local-runner steps,
  inline and container alike. The hot-path per-workspace rollup is indexed
  (`idx_token_usage_workspace` on `(workspace_id, created_at)`, both runtimes).

  **Per-workspace incident enrichment (service inspector → Post-release health).** PagerDuty

  - incident.io credentials are sealed in a new per-workspace `incident_enrichment_connections`
    table (one grouped blob) and resolved/decrypted at enrichment time by a new
    `WorkspaceIncidentEnrichmentProvider`. Removes env: `PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN`,
    `PAGERDUTY_FROM_EMAIL`, `INCIDENTIO_API_KEY`. The write API is three-state per provider
    group (omit ⇒ keep, `null` ⇒ clear, value ⇒ set) so one vendor can be removed without
    wiping the other.

  **Per-account integration secrets (Account settings → Deployment integrations, admin only).**
  The Slack app OAuth credentials and the container web-search upstream keys (Brave /
  SearXNG) now live in a new per-account `account_settings` table (one sealed secrets blob,
  HKDF tag `cat-factory:account-settings`), behind an admin-gated
  `GET|PUT /accounts/:id/settings`. Resolved dynamically: Slack OAuth at connect time, the
  web-search upstream per run (off the container session's account id). The executor now
  advertises the container `web_search` tool to a run **only when its account actually has
  keys** (so an agent is never handed a tool that always fails); a run with no upstream gets
  an empty result set rather than a hard `503`. Removes env:
  `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SLACK_REDIRECT_URL`, `WEB_SEARCH_BRAVE_API_KEY`,
  `WEB_SEARCH_SEARXNG_URL`, `WEB_SEARCH_SEARXNG_API_KEY` (the env-built upstream + its
  `createWebSearchUpstreamFromEnv`/`gateways.webSearch` fallback are deleted, not just
  unwired). (`SLACK_ENABLED` still gates Slack module assembly; the new tables/services
  assemble whenever `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set.)

  **Hardening.** Re-sealing a partial settings/credentials write now **refuses** (clear `409`)
  when the stored blob can't be decrypted (e.g. after an encryption-key change) instead of
  silently dropping the un-edited secret group on the re-seal.

  New tables mirror across both runtimes (D1 migrations 0012–0014 ⇄ Drizzle schema +
  generated migration) with cross-runtime conformance assertions for the budget +
  incident-enrichment round-trips. `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`, and the GitHub
  App/OAuth secrets stay in env (bootstrap/auth). Retention windows, inline-web-search
  toggles, Langfuse keys, and execution timeouts intentionally remain env-configured.

### Minor Changes

- ce81233: Surface optional/default config values and unconfigured-provider warnings for the
  ephemeral-environment and self-hosted runner-pool providers.

  - `ProviderConfigField` gains an optional `default`; a field that has one is optional
    (the connect form shows it blank with a "defaulted to …" hint and falls back to it).
  - `ProviderDescriptor` gains `missingRequired` (required-without-default keys not yet
    supplied — the loud-banner signal), an optional `manifestTemplate` scaffold, and the
    current `savedManifest` (non-secret) so the native connect form overlays edits onto the
    real stored manifest — preserving previously-saved `providerConfig` (incl. nested values
    the flat form doesn't render) instead of silently dropping it on a re-save.
  - A native `EnvironmentProvider` / `RunnerPoolProvider` may implement
    `describeManifestTemplate()` so the SPA renders a flat `describeConfig` connect form yet
    still persists a single full manifest (per `backend/docs/native-environment-adapter.md`).
  - Both connection services compute `missingRequired` server-side from the saved secret
    bundle + manifest `providerConfig` + manifest `baseUrl` (so a required `baseUrl` field,
    which is stored on the manifest rather than in providerConfig/secrets, can clear).
  - Frontend: a generic descriptor-driven connect panel for both providers (under
    Settings ▸ Integrations) and a loud `ProviderConfigBanner` that fires when a provider is
    wired for the instance but mandatory fields are missing.

### Minor Changes

- 6ff1f10: Link Confluence/Notion/GitHub documents as **living** best-practice fragments.

  A team can now link an external document (a Confluence page, a Notion page, or a
  GitHub file — any connected Document source) as a prompt-fragment whose guidance is
  **re-resolved from the source at the moment an agent run uses it**, rather than a
  one-time snapshot. Edit the upstream doc and the next agent run follows the new
  version — no re-import. The body is cached on the fragment as a last-resolved
  snapshot and refreshed on a short TTL (default 5 min); if the source is unreachable
  the run falls back to the cached body, so resolution never blocks a run. Available
  at both the account and workspace tiers; an account-tier link fetches through a
  chosen workspace's connection — recorded on the fragment so every consuming
  workspace re-resolves through that same connection at run time, not its own.

  New surface: `POST /:scope/document-fragments` (link a document as a fragment) and
  `POST /:scope/prompt-fragments/:id/refresh` (force an immediate re-resolve), a
  "Documents" tab in the fragment-library manager with a "Live · <source>" badge, and
  a `documentRef`/`resolvedAt` provenance block on `PromptFragment`.

  As part of this, run-time fragment-id resolution now goes through the merged tenant
  catalog (built-in ∪ account ∪ workspace) instead of only the built-in static pool,
  so **managed (DB-authored) fragments also reach a run** — previously only built-in
  ids resolved at run time. Behaviour is unchanged when the prompt-fragment library is
  not configured.

  Persistence: `prompt_fragments` gains `doc_source` / `doc_external_id` /
  `doc_via_workspace_id` / `resolved_at` columns on both runtimes (a D1 migration and
  a Drizzle migration); stale pre-existing rows simply carry nulls.

### Minor Changes

- be182e8: Hybrid linked-context delivery to agents, and deterministic reference resolution.

  Linked documents and tracker issues now reach a container agent as a cheap in-prompt
  summary index plus their full bodies materialised into a `.cat-context/` directory in the
  checkout (kept out of the agent's commits via a local git exclude), so the agent reads only
  what it needs on demand — replacing the previous 280-char document excerpt. Inline (no-
  checkout) agent kinds instead get the budgeted full body injected into the prompt.

  The engine also resolves references named explicitly in a block's description or its
  incorporated requirements (Jira keys like `PROJ-123`, fully-qualified GitHub `owner/repo#123`,
  and URLs) against the already-imported corpus, folding those high-confidence items into the
  context set. Each reference is resolved by a **point lookup** (a keyed `get`, or a new
  `getByUrl` repository method) rather than scanning the whole workspace corpus per step. Bare
  `#123` refs are intentionally not resolved: a workspace can hold many repos, so a bare number
  is ambiguous — name the issue as `owner/repo#123` (or by URL) to pull it in. There is no
  speculative relationship graph and no live fetching: everything is prepared backend-side,
  which is required because the container harness cannot reach Jira/Confluence/GitHub itself.

  Documents gain a `content_hash` column (D1 + Drizzle) so a re-import whose body AND title/url
  are unchanged is a no-op, preserving the existing projection and block link; a renamed/moved
  page still re-projects.

  Breaking (pre-1.0): `AgentRunContext.block.contextDocs` items now carry `summary` + `body`,
  `contextTasks` items carry `summary`, and `DocumentRecord` carries `contentHash`. The
  `DocumentRepository`/`TaskRepository` ports gain a `getByUrl` method (implemented on both the
  D1 and Drizzle stores). The executor-harness image gains an optional `contextFiles` job field;
  bump the runner image tag.

### Minor Changes

- 2c24da8: Add a **human-testing gate** (`human-test`) pipeline step. When reached it spins up an
  ephemeral environment and PARKS for a person to validate the change in the live URL before
  the run continues. From the dedicated window the human can confirm (tear the env down +
  advance), submit findings to dispatch the Tester's `fixer` (then the env rebuilds for
  re-testing), pull latest main into the PR branch + redeploy (a clean merge rebuilds the env; a
  conflict dispatches the `conflict-resolver`), or recreate / destroy the env on demand. Falls
  back to a degraded manual mode (no live env, still parks for confirmation) when no
  ephemeral-environment provider is wired.

  New opt-in pipeline `pl_human_review` (`coder → reviewer → human-test → conflicts → ci →
merger`) and a palette block; existing default pipelines are unchanged.

  Adds a `GitHubClient.mergeBranch` (the repo Merges API) and a `BranchUpdater` port behind the
  "pull main" action, wired from the GitHub client on every facade (Worker / Node / local), plus
  a `human_test_ready` notification type (in-app + Slack-routable). Both runtimes wire the gate
  identically and the cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the park → request-fix → confirm
  flow.

### Minor Changes

- 4120ac5: Nested tasks (epics) + a first-class task dependency graph.

  **Epics** are a new non-structural block level (`level: 'epic'`). An epic groups tasks
  that may live under different services/modules via the tasks' new `epicId` membership
  link (independent of `parentId`, so deleting an epic clears membership but never deletes
  the member tasks). The board draws an epic node linked to all its members, and the epic
  inspector shows the full member tree grouped service → module → task. Add one via
  `POST /workspaces/:ws/epics`; assign/detach a task via `POST /blocks/:id/epic`.

  **Importing a Jira epic / GitHub parent issue** spawns the epic + its children onto the
  board in one shot (`POST /workspaces/:ws/task-sources/:source/epics/spawn`, or the "As
  epic" button in the issue-import modal): an epic node, a board task per child issue
  (joined to the epic), and `dependsOn` edges seeded from the issues' **"blocked by" /
  "depends on"** links. Jira links come from `issuelinks` + `parent`/`subtasks` + epic
  children (JQL); GitHub children come from native **sub-issues** and dependency links are
  parsed from the issue body (`Blocked by #12`, `Depends on owner/repo#34`). The
  `GitHubClient` port gains `listSubIssues` + a `parentRef` on issue detail.

  **Dependency enforcement** is now hard and server-side: `ExecutionService.start()` refuses
  (409) to start a task while any block it `dependsOn` is unfinished — enforced for manual,
  recurring, auto-start and direct-API starts alike. Adding a dependency edge that would
  close a **cycle** is rejected (422).

  **Auto-start**: a preceding task carries an `autoStartDependents` toggle (task inspector).
  When it merges, the engine automatically starts every task that depends on it whose other
  dependencies are also done — skipping any on an individual-usage model (which can't unlock
  unattended).

  **Board UX**: a drag-to-connect handle on task cards creates dependency edges directly on
  the canvas (drag from the prerequisite onto the dependent); the dependency-edge overlay
  also draws epic→member membership links.

  Persisted on both runtimes (D1 migration `0010_epics_dependencies` ⇄ Drizzle
  `epic_id` / `auto_start_dependents` columns); the cross-runtime conformance suite asserts
  the epic + membership round-trip, the cycle rejection, and the dependency start gate on
  each store.

  Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable): the `blocks` table gains `epic_id` / `auto_start_dependents`
  columns and the `level` enum gains `epic`; no migration shims.

### Minor Changes

- 25efe48: Add UI-configurable provider config + per-user GitHub PAT, with provider self-describe and connection-test.

  - Providers self-describe the config they expect (`describeConfig`) and can be connection-tested (`testConnection`) before saving — added as optional methods on the `EnvironmentProvider` and `RunnerPoolProvider` kernel ports, implemented by the generic HTTP adapters (secret-key fields from the manifest + an authed probe), and surfaced via new `GET …/environments/provider`, `POST …/environments/connection/test`, `GET …/runner-pool/provider`, `POST …/runner-pool/connection/test` endpoints. The SPA renders the descriptor fields generically.
  - New generic, `kind`-discriminated per-user secret store (`user_secrets`, mirrored D1 ⇄ Drizzle) with `UserSecretService` + a kind registry (first kind: `github_pat`). User-scoped `GET/POST/DELETE /user-secrets` + `…/test`; a "My GitHub token" entry under Integrations → Source control.
  - A run you initiate now prefers YOUR stored GitHub PAT over the deployment's GitHub App / env token for the container push token AND the engine CI-gate + merge reads (resolved by the run initiator via an ambient `RunInitiatorScope`), falling back to the existing source when you have none. Wired symmetrically across the Cloudflare, Node and local facades.

  Breaking: none for existing data. The local-mode `GITHUB_PAT` env var still works as a fallback.

### Patch Changes

- 494fb34: Finish the Task-5 strangler: migrate the last two built-in agents (conflict-resolver and
  repo bootstrap) onto the single, manifest-driven `agent` harness kind, then delete every
  bespoke per-kind handler and collapse the dispatch surface. The harness is now a generic
  LLM-over-a-checkout runner with **one** kind — WHAT each agent does is decided entirely by
  the backend and carried as job data.

  **conflict-resolver** now dispatches `kind: 'agent'` `mode: 'coding'` with a `mergeBase`
  (full clone of the PR branch). `handleAgent`'s coding flow merges `origin/<mergeBase>` in to
  surface the conflicts, leads the prompt with the actual conflict hunks it discovers, then
  completes the merge commit and pushes back onto the same branch (no new PR) — refusing to
  push a half-resolved tree. Routed through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody`; the bespoke
  `/resolve-conflicts` body + handler are gone.

  **bootstrap** now dispatches `kind: 'agent'` `mode: 'coding'` with a `bootstrap` spec
  (`{ target, reference?, reinit, forcePush, fromScratch? }`). `handleAgent` clones the
  reference architecture (or scaffolds from an empty dir), runs the agent, guards against a
  no-op, then force-pushes a fresh single-commit history to the separate target repo's default
  branch (lifted `reinitAndPush` / `producedRepoContent`). `ContainerRepoBootstrapper` builds
  the generic body; its `linkRepoToBlock` post-op already lives in `pollBootstrapJob`.

  **Harness cleanup (image bump).** Deleted the bespoke handlers (`blueprint`/`spec`/`explore`/
  `merger`/`on-call`/`tester`/`ci-fixer`/`fixer`/`conflict-resolver`/`bootstrap`/`handleRun`),
  collapsed `server.ts`'s `KINDS` to `{ agent }`, and stripped the bespoke job types + parsers
  from `job.ts` (keeping `parseAgentJob` + the shared helpers + `BootstrapTargetSpec`). The
  executor-harness image is bumped (1.13.0 → 1.14.0; deploy tag + `wrangler.toml`).

  **Kernel (breaking, pre-1.0).** `RunnerDispatchKind` collapses to the single member
  `'agent'`, and `RunnerJobResult` is slimmed to `prUrl` / `branch` / `summary` / `error` /
  `defaultBranch` / `pushed` / `custom` / `usage` (the per-kind `service`/`spec`/`assessment`/
  `onCallAssessment`/`report`/`resolved` channels are removed — every structured agent returns
  its doc on `custom`, coerced kind-aware in `toRunResult`). The transports default to
  `kind: 'agent'`; the runner-pool result coercion passes only `custom` through.

  Two fixes ride along. (1) `toRunResult` now surfaces an opened PR (`prUrl`) **before** the
  in-place-fixer `pushed` branch — the migrated coder returns BOTH `pushed: true` and `prUrl`,
  so the previous ordering silently dropped its structured `pullRequest` (the worker test only
  passed because its fake omitted `pushed`). (2) The local transport ran the per-run container
  privileged off `kind === 'test'`, which never matched after the tester migration; the
  container is per-RUN (created by the run's first step, not the tester), so it now runs
  privileged whenever `privilegedTestJobs` is enabled (gated by the `localDind` capability).

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 0ac64b8: Add a "Create task from issue" button on service frames, and scope issue search to
  the service's repo.

  A service frame header now carries a ticket button (shown when a tracker is offered)
  that opens the tracker-issue modal pinned to that service: the new task is created in
  that frame, and the issue search is scoped to the service's linked GitHub repository
  instead of the whole installation. The same repo scoping applies to the
  attach-an-issue-as-context picker in the add-task form.

  Within a scoped GitHub search:

  - a pasted issue URL (or `owner/repo#n` / `owner/repo/issues/n`) resolves to that exact
    issue and is offered first instead of being fuzzy-matched — but only within the
    searching workspace's own GitHub App installation, so a URL naming another account is
    never fetched across tenants;
  - a bare issue number (`11`) resolves against the service's repo and is offered first;
  - free-text hits are restricted to the service's repo (`repo:owner/name`).

  A service is always created from (or with) a repo, so a GitHub search scoped to a block
  now REQUIRES that link: if the service isn't linked to a repo the search is refused with
  a clear error rather than silently widening to the whole installation. The
  block→service→repo resolver (`resolveRepoTarget`) is surfaced on the request container in
  both runtime facades so the shared task-search controller can resolve the scope.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- fde0437: Add a first-class **Issue tracker** settings panel (Workspace settings → Issue tracker,
  also linked from the Integrations hub) plus a **live "Check setup" diagnostic** so a
  workspace can both configure issue tracking in one place and see _why_ a source isn't
  working.

  **Panel (frontend).** One discoverable home that gathers what used to be scattered:

  - **Filing tracker** — select where the tech-debt recurring pipeline files its ticket
    (GitHub Issues / Jira / none). Previously only reachable buried inside the tech-debt
    recurring-pipeline modal, so a workspace had no obvious way to designate GitHub Issues.
  - **Linking sources** — the per-workspace on/off toggle for each task source, making
    explicit that filing and linking are independent.
  - **Writeback** — the comment-on-PR-open / close-on-merge toggles, folded in from the old
    standalone "Issue writeback" tab (`IssueTrackerWritebackPanel` is removed).

  **Live "Check setup" (backend, all runtimes).** A new
  `POST /workspaces/:ws/task-sources/:source/diagnostics` endpoint actually authenticates
  against the source and reads a slice of its issues API, returning a classified verdict —
  `ready` / `not_installed` / `not_connected` / `auth_failed` / `forbidden` / `unreachable` /
  `error` — with an actionable message. For GitHub Issues it escalates three probes
  (validate the App credentials → mint the installation token + list repos → read issues on a
  repo) so a 403 pinpoints the most common misconfiguration: the GitHub App lacks the
  **Issues** permission. For Jira it probes `/myself` and distinguishes a rejected token (401)
  from a forbidden account (403). The panel also now surfaces the previously-swallowed probe
  error (e.g. "503 — integration disabled / ENCRYPTION_KEY not set", "500 — backend not
  migrated") instead of a blanket "install integration first".

  Adds an optional `diagnose` capability to the `TaskSourceProvider` port (kernel), implemented
  by the GitHub and Jira providers and orchestrated by `TaskConnectionService.diagnose`
  (integrations), the `taskSourceDiagnosticSchema` wire contract (contracts), and the
  controller endpoint (server). Runtime-neutral — wired through the existing `tasks` module on
  Cloudflare, Node, and local — with a cross-runtime conformance assertion (gate-on-connection
  then delegate-to-provider). A provider without `diagnose` falls back to a static verdict
  from availability.

## 0.10.4

### Patch Changes

- 77b7d31: Migrate the `spec-writer` built-in agent onto the generic, manifest-driven `agent` harness
  kind, continuing the Task-5 strangler (after the read-only kinds, the merger/on-call/fixers,
  the coder, and blueprints).

  `ContainerAgentExecutor` now routes `spec-writer` through `buildMigratedBuiltInBody` →
  `buildRegisteredAgentBody` as a read-only `mode: 'explore'` structured agent that clones the
  per-block WORK branch (`cat-factory/<blockId>` — the coder's branch, created from base when
  absent; the spec-writer runs BEFORE the coder, so it seeds that branch) instead of the
  bespoke `/spec` body. The agent now READS the baseline spec from its own checkout under
  `spec/` (the harness no longer pre-injects it) and returns ONLY the complete spec doc as JSON;
  `toRunResult` coerces that `custom` result into the `spec` channel (via `coerceSpecDoc`) the
  engine already strict-validates + ingests. The `SPEC_WRITER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is updated to point
  the agent at `spec/overview.md` + the `spec/modules/**` shards, and a new `specWriterUserPrompt`
  carries the task increment + the read-the-baseline / reuse-the-taxonomy guidance the harness
  `buildUserPrompt`/`renderTaxonomyInventory` used to inject.

  The deterministic SHARD + commit of the in-repo `spec/` artifact that used to live in the
  executor-harness `/spec` handler now runs as a BACKEND built-in post-op (`specPostOp`,
  `@cat-factory/agents`), over the checkout-free `RepoFiles` port. It is keyed by the engine's
  own built-in op map in `ExecutionService` — deliberately NOT the agent-kind registry, so the
  built-ins never leak into `customAgentKinds` / the SPA palette. It reproduces the harness
  reconcile exactly: the canonical `service.json` / `overview.md` / `modules/<m>/<g>.{json,md}`
  shards are always rewritten and a removed module/group's shards are PRUNED (the deletion
  channel); the Gherkin `features/<m>/<g>.feature` files are SEEDED-ONCE (committed only when
  absent, never clobbering a polished one); and the pre-sharding monolithic artifacts
  (`spec/spec.json` / `rules.md` / `version.json`) + old flat `features/*.feature` files are
  dropped on sight. Idempotent: the spec has no `version.json` manifest, so the post-op
  byte-compares each rendered shard to the branch and makes NO commit when everything matches
  and there is nothing to seed or prune (durable-driver replay re-commits nothing).

  Because the spec doc is handed onward to be sharded + committed, the migrated kind opts into
  a new `output.failOnUnusableFinal` flag (kernel `AgentOutputSpec`) so the generic explore
  handler FAILS the run LOUDLY when the agent's final answer is cut off at the output ceiling
  (or empty) — restoring the bespoke `/spec` handler's `unusableFinalAnswerCause` gate, which
  the generic `handleAgent` path lacked, so a truncated reply can no longer be laundered into a
  half-baked spec by the structured repair. This is a harness change, so the executor-harness
  image is bumped to `1.12.0` (the `deploy/backend` `image:publish` tag + `wrangler.toml` are
  bumped to match). The dead `/spec` handler is removed in a later sweep step.

  Cross-runtime conformance asserts the post-op shards + commits the `spec/` artifact onto the
  work branch via `RepoFiles` on both runtimes.

  Also fixes a facade-parity gap in the self-hosted runner-pool result coercion
  (`HttpRunnerPoolProvider.coerceRunnerResult`): the generic `agent`-kind structured channel
  `custom` was missing from the pass-through allow-list, so a migrated kind's doc
  (blueprints / spec-writer / merger / on-call) was silently dropped on a runner-pool backend
  while the Cloudflare/local transports — which return the harness view verbatim — kept it.
  `custom` now passes through, and a regression test covers it.

### Minor Changes

- 5c915fd: Replace the deployment-level `TASK_SOURCES` env allow-list with a per-workspace,
  UI-driven on/off toggle for each task source (Jira / GitHub Issues), persisted in DB.

  A source is now offered to a workspace when it is **available** AND **enabled**:

  - Availability is intrinsic, not a deployment switch. Jira is always registered (its
    credentials are per-workspace, entered in the UI) and is available once connected.
    GitHub Issues registers whenever the GitHub integration is configured and is available
    once the workspace has installed the GitHub App — it rides that App, so there is nothing
    to "connect" (the credentialless connect path now returns a clear error).
  - `enabled` is the new per-workspace toggle (defaults to on). A workspace can disable
    GitHub Issues to use GitHub repos without offering their issues, or park a connected
    Jira without disconnecting it. A disabled source is hidden from the import/link UI and
    its import/search endpoints are refused (409).

  New surface:

  - `task_source_settings` table, mirrored D1 (migration `0008_task_source_settings.sql`)
    ⇄ Drizzle (`taskSourceSettings` + generated migration), behind a new
    `TaskSourceSettingsRepository` kernel port.
  - `GET /workspaces/:ws/task-sources` now returns each source's descriptor plus
    `available` + `enabled`; `PUT /workspaces/:ws/task-sources/:source/enabled` toggles it.
  - The SPA settings modal hosts the toggle, and import entry points key off the offered
    (available + enabled) set instead of raw connections.

  BREAKING: the `TASK_SOURCES` env var (Cloudflare `wrangler.toml` / Node `.env`) and
  `TasksConfig.sources` are removed. Delete `TASK_SOURCES` from any deployment config —
  which sources a workspace uses is now controlled in the app, not by the operator.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 4de2f5f: Declutter settings/navbar and make post-release health a pluggable observability integration.

  **Frontend**

  - Workspace settings is now a single tabbed window: **Merge thresholds**, **Issue writeback**
    and **Default service best practices** moved from standalone modals into tabs (their navbar/
    command-bar entries now deep-link to the tab). Fixed the **Mode** select clipping its options.
  - Removed the **Add a block** button and **all** "Add &lt;type&gt; block" command-bar commands
    (services come from Bootstrap / Add-from-repo, tasks from the add-task flow); dropped the
    unsupported `external` / `environment` block types.
  - The new-task form now shows **Context documents** and **Context issues** sections (inspector-
    style) **ungated** — the _Attach_ button is disabled with a tooltip until the relevant
    integration is connected. (`ContextPicker.vue` removed.)
  - Post-release health is no longer a Datadog-named window: the **connection** is an
    **Observability** entry in the Integrations hub (`ObservabilityConnectionPanel`, provider
    picker — Datadog today), and the per-service **monitor/SLO mapping** moved into the **service
    inspector** (`ServiceReleaseHealthConfig`, keyed by the selected frame — no manual block-id
    entry, disabled with a hint until a connection exists).

  **Backend — pluggable observability (Datadog = one adapter)**

  - The `ReleaseHealthProvider` is now served by `RegistryReleaseHealthProvider`, a registry of
    per-vendor adapters; the Datadog logic became `DatadogObservabilityAdapter`. Adding a second
    provider is a new registry entry — the gate, service, routes and persistence are vendor-neutral.

  **Breaking (acceptable per pre-1.0 policy — no migration):**

  - Persistence: the `datadog_connections` table is **dropped** and replaced by
    `observability_connections` (`provider` discriminator + a single sealed `credentials` JSON blob
    - a non-secret `summary`), mirrored D1 ⇄ Drizzle. Existing connections must be re-entered.
  - Kernel: `DatadogConnectionRecord`/`DatadogConnectionRepository` →
    `ObservabilityConnectionRecord`/`ObservabilityConnectionRepository` (+ `ObservabilityProviderKind`).
  - Contracts: `upsertDatadogConnectionSchema` / `datadogConnectionViewSchema` →
    `upsertObservabilityConnectionSchema` / `observabilityConnectionViewSchema` (now `{ provider,
credentials }` / `{ connected, provider, summary }`), plus `observabilityConnectionSummary`.
  - HTTP: `GET|PUT|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/datadog/connection` → `…/observability/connection`.
  - Config/env: `DATADOG_ENABLED` → `OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED`; `AppConfig.datadog` → `AppConfig.releaseHealth`
    (`DatadogConfig` → `ReleaseHealthConfig`); the sealed-secret domain tag `cat-factory:datadog` →
    `cat-factory:observability`.

  Note: the cross-runtime conformance suite does not yet cover the observability connection CRUD
  (it never covered the Datadog connection either); both facades wire the same repos/cipher/provider
  and ship mirrored D1 + Drizzle migrations.

### Patch Changes

- 4de2f5f: Review fixes for the declutter/observability pass:

  - **Board no longer crashes on `external`/`environment` blocks.** Those types stay
    user-uncreatable, but the backend still emits them (the seeded third-party service and
    the environments integration), so they are restored to the frontend `BlockType` union +
    `BLOCK_TYPE_META` for display parity with the contracts `blockTypeSchema`. `blockTypeMeta()`
    adds a safe fallback so an unknown/legacy block type degrades instead of throwing on the board.
  - **Integrations hub gates the Observability row on availability.** The `releaseHealth` store
    now probes an `available` flag (mirroring the other integration stores); the hub hides the
    "Post-release health" entry when `OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED` is off, instead of showing a dead
    row that only 503s.
  - **De-duplicated release-health loads.** `ensureLoaded()` coalesces repeated hub opens /
    frame-inspector mounts so they reuse the resolved connection + configs rather than re-fetching
    the whole configs list on every service selection.
  - **Vendor-neutral gate message.** The post-release-health pipeline guard now says "Connect an
    observability provider" instead of the leftover "Connect Datadog".
  - **Validated credentials at the registry boundary.** `parseDatadogCredentials` validates the
    decrypted blob in the observability registry, so a drifted/corrupted row fails with a clear
    error instead of deep inside the Datadog client during a live probe.

### Minor Changes

- ae29687: OpenRouter: dynamic multi-tenant catalog + flavour unification.

  **Flavour unification.** A catalog model can now carry an `openrouter` flavour alongside
  `cloudflare`/`direct`/`subscription`. `effectiveVariant` resolves in the precedence
  direct → openrouter → cloudflare (the subscription override still wins in `ModelRouter`),
  so the SAME logical model routes through OpenRouter when only an OpenRouter key is
  configured, and through its native vendor when that key is present. The standalone
  `openrouter-*` catalog entries are folded into their native twins: `deepseek`, `gpt-5.5`
  and `claude-opus` gain an `openrouter` route; Gemini 3 Pro becomes a curated `gemini`
  entry. **Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable):** the catalog ids `openrouter-claude-opus`,
  `openrouter-gpt`, `openrouter-deepseek`, `openrouter-gemini-pro` and `openrouter-llama`
  are removed — a block pinned to one falls through to default routing.

  **Dynamic catalog.** A workspace can now browse OpenRouter's live `/models` and enable a
  subset in the UI (the new "OpenRouter models" panel), rather than a hardcoded handful.
  Enabled models surface in the per-workspace picker as `openrouter:<slug>` entries with
  their live context window and price (overlaid onto the spend table, so budgets meter
  accurately). Persisted in a new generic per-workspace `provider_model_catalog` table
  (D1 ⇄ Drizzle, keyed by `(workspace_id, provider)` so future gateways like LiteLLM reuse
  it), behind the new kernel `ProviderModelCatalogRepository` port and the
  `OpenRouterCatalogService` (refresh leases the workspace's pooled OpenRouter key). New
  routes: `GET|PUT /workspaces/:ws/openrouter/catalog`, `POST /workspaces/:ws/openrouter/refresh`.
  Cross-runtime conformance asserts the enabled-subset round-trip + catalog surfacing on
  both D1 and Postgres.

### Minor Changes

- fe53445: Add an existing GitHub repository to the board as a service, with no bootstrap
  run. A new "Add from existing repo" button (sidebar, Repositories section) opens
  a picker of repos the GitHub App can access — including ones the workspace
  doesn't track yet — plus a link to grant the App access to more repos. Importing
  links + syncs the repo into the workspace (if needed), creates a `ready` service
  frame titled after the repo, and links the repo projection to it so tasks dropped
  on the frame target that repo. Backed by `POST /workspaces/:ws/blocks/from-repo`
  (`BoardService.addServiceFromRepo` + `GitHubSyncService.linkRepo`).
- db77061: Refuse to pool individual-use-only subscriptions on a workspace.

  Some subscriptions are licensed for individual use only, so a single credential may not
  be shared across a workspace (any member's run leasing it). `SUBSCRIPTION_VENDORS` now
  carries an `individualOnly` flag, set — from each vendor's own terms of service — for
  `claude` (Anthropic consumer Pro/Max), `glm` (Z.ai's GLM Coding Plan is "licensed only
  to the individual natural person") and `codex` (a ChatGPT `auth.json` is a per-seat
  credential, sharing prohibited at every tier). The genuinely org-permitted coding-plan
  vendors `kimi` (Moonshot explicitly permits authorized enterprise use) and `deepseek` (a
  commercial API platform) stay poolable.

  `ProviderSubscriptionService` enforces it account-agnostically: `addToken`/`leaseToken`
  throw a `ConflictError` (HTTP 409) for any `individualOnly` vendor, and `hasToken` always
  reports it unavailable so the executor's "subscriptions always win" routing never
  auto-selects a vendor a lease would reject. The rule is asserted in the cross-runtime
  conformance suite against an org-owned workspace, and the LLM Vendors UI offers only the
  poolable vendors (the individual-use ones are connected per-user in the Personal
  subscriptions section). Organizations needing shared, programmatic access use a direct
  provider API key instead, which is unaffected by the flag.

- 8065fed: Make the CI / conflicts gates observable. The gate window now shows the run id
  (copyable, with a jump into observability), a per-attempt history of every
  ci-fixer / conflict-resolver run (what each tried and how it ended), and — for
  the conflicts gate — the resolver's own account of which files it left
  conflicting (GitHub's API exposes mergeability as a single bit, so this comes
  from the resolver, plus a link to inspect the PR on GitHub). Failing CI checks
  now link straight to their GitHub run logs.

  Mechanically: `GateStepState` gains an append-only `attemptLog`; the engine
  records each gate-helper attempt when its job finishes (previously discarded the
  moment the gate re-probed) and sets the conflicts gate's `lastFailureSummary`
  from the resolver's output. `CiCheck` / `gateFailingCheckSchema` /
  `githubCheckRunSchema` carry the check run's `html_url` so the UI can link to it
  (populated on the live check-runs read; not persisted to the projection). The
  conflict-resolver result mapping now surfaces the still-conflicting file list
  (its `error`) instead of dropping it.

  Also tightens the conflict-resolver prompt: lockfiles (`package-lock.json`,
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`, …) must be regenerated via the package
  manager rather than hand-merged — large generated files are what exhausted the
  resolver's context window and left big conflict sets unresolved.

- 0972696: Surface external context sources in the add-task popup, with search + a new GitHub
  repo-doc source.

  The task-creation popup gains a `ContextPicker`: pick a connected source
  (Confluence, Notion, GitHub repo docs, Jira, GitHub issues), then **search its
  catalogue by title/content**, paste a page/issue URL, or pick something already
  imported — chosen items are imported and linked to the new task as agent context
  when it's created. Previously the popup could only tick already-imported items and
  there was no in-UI way to reach the catalogue.

  - **Search** is a new optional capability on the document/task source providers
    (`search?(credentials, query)`), exposed as `POST
/workspaces/:ws/{document,task}-sources/:source/search`. Implemented for
    Confluence (CQL), Notion (`/v1/search`), Jira (JQL), GitHub issues
    (`/search/issues`) and GitHub docs (`/search/code`). The `GitHubClient` port
    gains `searchIssues` / `searchCode`. Descriptors advertise `searchable` so the UI
    knows when to offer a search box.
  - **GitHub repo docs** are a new `github` document source: link a Markdown/text
    file from a repo (README, RFC, architecture note) by URL or `owner/repo:path`, or
    by code-search. Like GitHub issues it reuses the workspace's installed GitHub App
    (no credentials of its own) and is wired only when the GitHub integration is on.

- e9b9356: Create board tasks directly from imported GitHub issues or Jira tickets.

  Previously an imported issue could only be attached to an _existing_ task block as
  agent context. The task-source integration now also materialises an issue as a
  brand-new board task: `TaskLinkService.createTaskFromIssue` seeds a leaf block
  (title `KEY: summary`, description = a source-reference line + the issue body)
  inside a chosen service frame or module via `BoardService.addTask`, then links the
  issue to the new task so every agent step still sees the full issue (description,
  comments, metadata) as context. The issue stays the source of truth — re-importing
  refreshes it. Backed by `POST /workspaces/:ws/tasks/create-block`
  (`{ source, externalId, containerId }` → `{ block, task }`). In the UI, the
  task-source import modal gains a "create tasks in" container picker and a per-issue
  "Create task" action.

  The new task carries `createdBy` (the signed-in user, threaded through the widened
  `BoardWritePort.addTask`) for notification routing, the container is resolved in the
  request workspace so the workspace-scoped issue link always resolves at execution
  time, and creating a second task from an already-linked issue is refused (`409`)
  rather than silently re-pointing the single issue→block link. The shared
  cross-runtime conformance suite now asserts the whole create-task-from-issue flow
  (seeded over a deterministic task source) against BOTH the Cloudflare/D1 and the
  Node/Postgres facades.

  Also closes two cross-runtime parity gaps in the task-source layer so the feature
  works identically on both facades:

  - **GitHub issues as a task source now work on the Node runtime.** The
    runtime-neutral `GitHubIssuesProvider` (it depends only on the `GitHubClient` /
    `GitHubInstallationRepository` ports) moved from the Cloudflare package into the
    shared `@cat-factory/integrations`, the Node facade wires it whenever a GitHub
    client is available (the App is configured) — mirroring the Worker's
    `config.github.enabled` gate — AND `github` was added to the Node facade's
    task-source allow-list (it had been omitted, so the provider could never register).
    Previously only the Worker offered GitHub issues.
  - **Jira search now works on the Node runtime.** The duplicated per-runtime
    `JiraProvider` was hoisted into the shared `@cat-factory/integrations` (it is a thin
    runtime-neutral `fetch` shell, like `GitHubIssuesProvider`), so both facades now
    compose the SAME class — including `search()`, which the legacy Node copy had
    silently dropped.

- e8005ba: Datadog post-release-health gate + Agent-On-Call.

  After a release ships, a new **`post-release-health`** polling gate watches the team's
  Datadog **monitors/SLOs** over a monitoring window. It reuses the existing gate machinery
  (`ci`/`conflicts`): a clean window advances with nothing spun up; a regression escalates —
  Datadog credentials stay on the backend and never enter containers.

  The gate is **opt-in**: it is NOT in any default pipeline. A user adds it deliberately in
  the pipeline builder, and it only appears in the palette — and is only accepted by the
  backend — once the workspace has an **observability integration connected** (today a
  Datadog connection). `PipelineService` rejects a `create`/`update` that adds an enabled
  `post-release-health` step otherwise.

  - **No blind revert.** On a regression the gate dispatches an **`on-call`** container agent
    that clones the base branch (the merged release; the work branch is deleted on merge),
    locates the merged commit and correlates its diff with the regression evidence (alerting
    monitors/SLOs + recent error logs), returning a JSON assessment (culprit confidence +
    `revert`/`hold`/`monitor` recommendation). It makes no commits and reverts nothing — the
    engine raises a **`release_regression`** notification for a human to decide. The gate only
    engages once the PR actually merged, attributes only post-release alerts (not pre-existing
    ones) to the release, and honours the full configured watch window even when it outlasts a
    single poll budget.
  - **Datadog connection + monitor/SLO mapping** are per-workspace (keys sealed at rest under
    a `cat-factory:datadog` cipher, write-only), managed in a new settings panel and the
    `GET|PUT|DELETE /workspaces/:ws/datadog/connection` + `/release-health-configs/:blockId`
    API. The gate maps a run's repo to its service-frame config (monitor + SLO ids + env tag).
  - **Merge-preset knobs**: `releaseWatchWindowMinutes` (default 30) and `releaseMaxAttempts`
    (default 1) bound the watch window + on-call dispatches.
  - **Incident enrichment (optional, additive):** PagerDuty / incident.io are NOT used to
    re-alert (they already page off the same monitors/SLOs) — instead the on-call
    investigation is posted onto an incident they already opened (annotate, never duplicate),
    behind a new `IncidentEnrichmentProvider` port. Slack + the in-app inbox carry the
    human-facing `release_regression` notification.
  - Runtime-symmetric: D1 (`datadog_connections`, `release_health_configs` + the two preset
    columns) ⇄ Drizzle/Postgres, wired in both the Cloudflare Worker and Node/local facades.
  - New harness route `POST /on-call`; the executor-harness image is bumped to `1.7.1`.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, acceptable):** `merge_threshold_presets` gains two columns — stale rows
  are re-seeded with the defaults.

- b40da13: Simplify task granularity and run configuration; open the pipeline-step detail
  overlay from the zoomed-in board.

  - **Open the agent step-detail overlay from the board.** Clicking a pipeline agent
    in a zoomed-in task card now opens the full `AgentStepDetail` overlay (execution
    metadata + the agent's prose output), exactly like clicking it from the inspector
    or the focus-view pipeline — instead of expanding raw text inside the card.
  - **Removed the per-task auto-merge "confidence threshold".** The confidence-score
    auto-merge gate (`Block.confidenceThreshold`, the inspector + task-card UI, the
    `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` constant) is gone; the `merger` step's merge-policy
    preset (complexity/risk/impact ceilings) is the sole auto-merge gate. (The raw
    `confidence` score is still recorded for transparency.)
  - **Removed "feature" tracking from the board and the service map.** `Block.features`
    (the inspector's "Features implemented" tags and the board/module feature badges)
    is removed, and the in-repo blueprint / board-scan decomposition is now
    service → modules only — the Blueprinter, harness rendering, and reconciliation no
    longer produce a "feature" sub-level or derive tasks from it. Acceptance scenarios
    are now freeform per task (decoupled from features) pending a deeper
    requirements-driven model.
  - **Task creation picks a pipeline + merge policy; model selection removed.** The
    "Add a task" modal now offers a default pipeline (`Block.pipelineId`, which the
    task's Run/Start controls use) and a merge policy preset. The per-task model
    picker is gone — a model is resolved per step, not per task.

  Migration `0025_task_run_config.sql` drops the `confidence_threshold` and `features`
  columns and adds `pipeline_id`. Bumps `@cat-factory/executor-harness` (the blueprint
  rendering inside its image changed).

- 084bf43: Widen the env-provisioning + runner-pool surface so an external orchestration adapter
  (e.g. an in-house PR-environment platform) can be written on top of our ports and wired
  into a stock facade build, without forking the facades.

  - `EnvironmentProvider` provision requests now carry a typed `provisionContext`
    (branch / PR number+url / repo owner+name, derived from the block's PR ref) and the same
    values are flattened into `{{input.*}}` for the manifest path. The deployer step supplies
    it. A PR-environment provider needs the git ref + repo to target the right environment.
  - New `UrlSafetyPolicy` (kernel) + `resolveUrlSafetyPolicy` (server): the env + runner-pool
    URL/host guard is now policy-driven. The default stays strict (https-only, no
    private/internal hosts); a TRUSTED operator can widen it per facade to reach an internal
    platform on a private/VPN host. The two integrations are scoped **independently** — each
    resolves its own policy from its own config slice, so widening one (`ENVIRONMENTS_*`) does
    not widen the other's (`RUNNERS_*`) SSRF guard. Config: `ENVIRONMENTS_ALLOW_URL_HOSTS` /
    `ENVIRONMENTS_ALLOW_HTTP_URLS` and `RUNNERS_ALLOW_URL_HOSTS` / `RUNNERS_ALLOW_HTTP_URLS`
    (Node env vars + the matching Worker `[vars]`).
  - The Node facade's `buildNodeContainer` gains a documented `environmentProvider` seam (the
    Worker injects via `buildContainer`'s `overrides`); a custom adapter replaces the default
    manifest-driven `HttpEnvironmentProvider` while the env repos + secret cipher still wire
    from config. The local facade inherits the seam through `buildNodeContainer`.

  No backwards-incompatible changes: every addition is optional and defaults to today's
  behaviour.

- db77061: Add an **individual-usage restricted mode** for subscriptions licensed for personal
  use only (`claude`, `glm` and `codex` — see their terms of service). Such vendors are no
  longer poolable on a workspace; instead each user stores their OWN credential and only
  that user's runs may use it.

  - **Per-user, double-encrypted storage.** A personal subscription's token is sealed
    under a key derived from the user's personal **password** (PBKDF2 → AES-GCM, never
    stored) and then encrypted again with the system key, so it cannot be recovered
    without BOTH the system key AND the password. New `personal_subscriptions` table on
    both runtimes (D1 migration `0039` ⇄ Drizzle), `PersonalSubscriptionService`, and
    `GET/POST/DELETE /personal-subscriptions` (user-scoped).
  - **One password per user.** All of a user's individual-usage subscriptions must share a
    single personal password (enforced at store time), since a run unlocks every vendor it
    touches with one password. Passwords are restricted to printable ASCII so they are
    HTTP-header-safe.
  - **Per-run activation, short TTL, transparently extended.** At task start/retry the user
    supplies their password — carried on the ambient `X-Personal-Password` header (never a
    body field), cached client-side (~40h) so it usually rides along transparently — to mint a
    short-lived (~12h), system-encrypted, per-run activation (`subscription_activations`
    table) that the asynchronous container steps lease, so the whole step chain authenticates
    without the user present. The activation is **re-minted from the cached password on each
    interaction** (resolve a decision / approve a step / retry), so an actively-tended run
    never lapses under the short TTL; the user is only re-prompted once the password cache
    expires. Activations are deleted when the run finishes (or its block's run is replaced)
    and swept on TTL expiry.
  - **No recurring runs.** A recurring schedule whose block resolves to an individual-usage
    model — by pin **or** workspace per-kind default — is refused at fire time (it can't be
    unlocked unattended).
  - **Gating.** Starting/retrying a run that resolves to individual-usage model(s)
    requires a signed-in user with the stored subscription(s); a missing password returns
    `428 credential_required` so the client prompts. The gate mirrors dispatch's model
    precedence (block pin → workspace per-kind default) across the pipeline's steps, so a
    block with no pin but an individual-usage workspace default is gated up-front instead
    of failing at dispatch. The container executor leases the initiator's activation and
    fails clearly (retryable) if it has lapsed. Expiry/renewal is surfaced in advance.

  **Breaking (no migration — backwards compatibility is a non-goal here):** `glm` and `codex`
  join `claude` as individual-only, and individual-only vendors are no longer poolable on ANY
  workspace. Any existing **pooled** `claude`/`glm`/`codex` workspace tokens become orphaned
  (no longer leased or listed) — reconnect them as personal subscriptions.

  See `backend/docs/individual-subscription-usage.md` for the full model + safeguards.

- 6406c8c: Extract `@cat-factory/integrations` — GitHub, documents, tasks, environments, and runners modules are now a standalone package. `@cat-factory/core` re-exports the full public surface for backward compatibility. `BoardWritePort` added to `@cat-factory/kernel` so `DocumentLinkService` can depend on a narrow port rather than the concrete `BoardService`.
- 57d70fa: Issue-tracker writeback: comment on a task's linked tracker issue when its PR
  opens, and comment + close the issue as resolved when the PR merges.

  Two independent toggles configured at the **workspace** level (on the existing
  tracker settings) and overridable **per task** in the inspector
  (`commentOnPrOpen`, `resolveOnMerge`; each task override is `inherit`/`on`/`off`).
  The linked issue(s) come from the existing task projection (`linkedBlockId`), so
  writeback targets whatever GitHub/Jira issue is attached to the task. All writeback
  is best-effort — a tracker outage never fails a run.

  GitHub issues close natively (`state_reason: completed`); Jira issues transition to
  the first status in their standard **Done** category (no manual status mapping). The
  new `IssueWritebackService` mirrors `TicketTrackerService`'s per-facade seams and is
  wired on both the Cloudflare and Node runtimes; the `GitHubClient` port gains a
  `closeIssue` method.

  **Breaking (pre-1.0, no migration):** the `tracker_settings` table gains
  `writeback_comment_on_pr_open` / `writeback_resolve_on_merge` columns and `blocks`
  gains `tracker_comment_on_pr_open` / `tracker_resolve_on_merge` (D1 migration `0005`
  ⇄ a generated Drizzle migration). Both default to off/inherit, so existing data is
  unaffected.

- 918764f: Add optional, opt-in **Langfuse** LLM observability. A new fetch-based
  `@cat-factory/observability-langfuse` package implements a runtime-neutral
  `LlmTraceSink` (new kernel port) against Langfuse's ingestion API — no Node SDK or
  OpenTelemetry, so it runs unchanged on BOTH the Cloudflare Worker (workerd) and Node
  facades.

  Proxied container-agent calls and inline (non-proxied) calls — requirements
  review/rework, document planner, fragment selector, the inline agent — flow through the
  SAME sink path: the orchestration `LlmObservabilityService` fans every recorded proxied
  call out as a generation, and an `InstrumentedModelProvider` wraps every resolved model
  so inline `generateText` calls surface the identical `LlmGenerationEvent`. Calls are
  grouped under one trace per run (`executionId`); inline single-shot calls become their
  own standalone trace.

  Off unless `LANGFUSE_ENABLED=true` and both keys are set; wired symmetrically in both
  runtime containers. Honours the existing `LLM_RECORD_PROMPTS` switch (prompt/response
  bodies are omitted from Langfuse too when disabled). The sink never throws into the LLM
  path — failures are swallowed and logged. The existing local metric store, spend gating
  and board rollups are unchanged; Langfuse is an additive external sink, not a
  replacement.

- f73652c: LLM key management overhaul: DB-backed, multi-scope, pooled provider API keys;
  opt-in Cloudflare AI; provider-gated pipelines; account roles.

  - **Direct-provider API keys move from env to the DB** (BREAKING). The
    OpenAI/Anthropic/Qwen/DeepSeek/Moonshot keys that were read from
    `*_API_KEY` env vars are now onboarded via the UI and stored encrypted (the
    shared `WebCryptoSecretCipher`, HKDF info `cat-factory:provider-api-keys`).
    They are pooled and leased with usage-aware rotation, and scoped to an
    **account, workspace, or user** — within a workspace the candidate pool merges
    the workspace's keys, its owning account's keys, and the run initiator's own
    user keys. Operators must re-enter their keys via the app after upgrading.
  - **Cloudflare Workers AI is no longer assumed available.** It becomes a separate
    opt-in provider lib (like `provider-bedrock`), explicitly registered per
    deployment (the Worker `AI` binding; Node REST account/token). The unconditional
    `workers-ai` fallback is removed, so a bare deployment exposes no models until a
    key is added or the Cloudflare lib is enabled.
  - **Model selectability is derived from what is configured**, and starting a
    pipeline is blocked when any step's canonical model has no usable provider
    (no direct key, no subscription, no registered registry).
  - **Account roles** (admin / developer / product, combinable) layered on the
    membership model: only admins may modify org-account settings; a product member
    can be set as a task's responsible person and is notified when requirement review
    raises findings.

- 8807f5c: Run agents on locally-hosted LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, or any
  custom OpenAI-compatible server). Each user configures their own runners in
  Settings → "My local runners" (a runner lives on that person's machine), stored
  per-user in the DB with on-the-fly connection validation that probes the runner's
  `/v1/models` and lists the installed models to enable. The enabled models appear
  in the picker as the `direct` flavour and need no API key — the LLM proxy resolves
  the run initiator's endpoint and skips the DB key lease (new optional
  `LlmUpstreamEndpoint.apiKey` signal / keyless local branch), and inline LLM calls
  register the user's runners as keyless resolvers. Resolution is by the run
  initiator, exactly like personal subscriptions.

  New per-user `local_model_endpoints` table mirrored across both runtimes (D1
  migration `0002` ⇄ Drizzle), a user-scoped `GET|PUT|DELETE /local-model-endpoints`

  - `POST /local-model-endpoints/test` API, and a cross-runtime conformance
    assertion for the store (CRUD + bearer-key encryption round-trip + enabled-models
    JSON). Container kinds (coder/tester/merger/…) and the inline reviewer/planner all
    run on the local model. Breaking only in the pre-1.0 sense: a new table is added,
    no migration of existing data is needed.

  Because the user-supplied base URL is forwarded server-side (the test probe + the
  LLM proxy), it is constrained to a loopback/LAN allow-list (`localRunnerUrlError`):
  `localhost`, `*.local`, and RFC1918/ULA private addresses are accepted, while public
  hosts and the link-local cloud-metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254` / `fe80::`) are
  rejected at the write boundary and the probe (anti-SSRF). Model usability is gated on
  the specific enabled model id (`localModels` capability), not merely the runner being
  configured, so a stale pin to a since-disabled model is caught at the pipeline-start
  guard.

- 5ec0d25: Real merge lifecycle: CI gate + CI-fixer, merger agent, and notifications.

  A task now becomes `done` only when its pull request is **actually merged** on
  GitHub — fixing the bug where a task showed "merged" (and a green board) from a
  confidence score alone, while CI was red and the PR still open.

  - **CI gate (`ci` step)** — auto-inserted before the merger in the standard
    pipelines. It polls the PR head's GitHub check runs and, on failure, dispatches a
    new **`ci-fixer`** container agent that pushes a fix to the PR branch, looping up
    to a configurable budget (default 10) until CI is green; polling stops the moment
    CI goes green. If the budget is spent it raises a `ci_failed` notification.
  - **Merger agent (`merger` step)** — runs last. A container agent scores the PR's
    complexity / risk / impact, and the engine compares those against the task's
    **merge threshold preset** to either auto-merge (a real GitHub merge) or raise a
    `merge_review` notification for a human. Presets are a per-workspace library
    (selectable per task); the CI-fixer attempt budget lives on the preset.
  - **`merger` is appended to the standard pipelines.** A pipeline with no merger now
    raises a `pipeline_complete` notification on completion (confirm + merge) instead
    of silently marking the task done.
  - **Notifications** — a new first-class, human-actionable board surface (inbox +
    events), modelled behind a `NotificationChannel` port so email/Slack delivery can
    be added later without touching the call sites. In-app delivery only for now.

  Adds migration `0024_merge_lifecycle.sql` (notifications + merge-preset tables, the
  `blocks.merge_preset_id` column). The executor-harness image gains `/ci-fix` and
  `/merge` endpoints (version bumped so the GHCR image is re-tagged).

- a691853: Monorepo support: select a subset of a repo's services and pin each to a subdirectory.

  A linked GitHub repository can now be flagged a **monorepo** (`github_repos.is_monorepo`,
  D1 migration `0044` ⇄ Drizzle), which lets it back **more than one** board service —
  each pinned to its own subdirectory (`services.directory`). The "Add service from repo"
  modal gains a monorepo toggle and a **directory browser** (`GET
/workspaces/:ws/github/repos/:id/tree`, served from GitHub's contents API via
  `GitHubSyncService.listRepoDirectory`) so you can explore the repo and pick the
  directory of the service you want — and add several (a subset of the repo's services).
  `PATCH /workspaces/:ws/github/repos/:id` sets the monorepo flag.

  The chosen subdirectory is **fed to the agents that build the service** when the repo is
  a monorepo: `buildResolveRepoTarget` resolves a frame's service (so multiple frames can
  target one repo) and returns its `serviceDirectory`, which flows through the container
  job body into the harness. The implementation agents — **coder, mocker and ci-fixer**
  (everything routed through `runCodingAgent`) — run with their working directory set to
  that subtree and are told, in their AGENTS.md context, that they're in a monorepo and to
  scope their work (and build/test commands) to it. The cross-cutting agents keep operating
  at the repo root by design: the **conflict-resolver** and **merger** act on the whole
  merge / diff, and the **blueprint** and **requirements** agents write repo-root artifacts.
  Non-monorepo repos keep the historical whole-repo behaviour.

  Known limitation: the in-repo blueprint (`blueprints/`) and requirements (`requirements/`)
  artifacts are still written at the repo root, so two services backed by the same monorepo
  share — and would overwrite — those files. Per-service artifact paths are a follow-up.

- c664fe6: Run container agent steps on the Node service via a self-hosted runner pool, so the
  Node facade no longer silently degrades repo-operating kinds (coder, mocker,
  playwright, blueprints, ci-fixer, conflict-resolver, merger) to useless one-shot LLM
  calls.

  The container-execution machinery is now shared, not Worker-only:

  - `@cat-factory/server` hosts the runtime-neutral `CompositeAgentExecutor`,
    `ContainerAgentExecutor` and `RunnerJobClient`, plus the Web-Crypto
    `WebCryptoSecretCipher` and GitHub-App auth (`GitHubAppAuth` / `GitHubAppRegistry`).
  - `@cat-factory/integrations` hosts the manifest-driven runner-pool transport
    (`HttpRunnerPoolProvider` / `RunnerPoolTransport`).
  - `@cat-factory/server` also hosts the runtime-neutral `buildResolveRepoTarget` (the
    security-sensitive block→service→repo ancestry walk, with its no-"first-repo"-fallback
    policy), so the Worker and Node service single-source it instead of keeping two
    hand-copied resolvers that could drift. Each facade just binds its own repositories.
  - `@cat-factory/worker` keeps thin re-export shims at the old paths (no API change).

  `@cat-factory/node-server` wires a `CompositeAgentExecutor` (inline + container) whose
  container executor dispatches to a workspace's registered runner pool
  (`RunnerPoolTransport`), resolving the run's repo + minting a short-lived GitHub
  installation token exactly as the Worker does. New Postgres tables
  (`runner_pool_connections`, `github_installations`, `github_repos`) mirror the D1
  schema. It activates when `GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `PUBLIC_URL`,
  `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` are configured; otherwise inline
  kinds still work and container kinds fail loudly rather than faking success.

- 7d5e060: Bridge the Cloudflare ⇄ Node/local runtime feature-parity gaps: seven product
  features that worked on the Worker but `503`'d on the Node + local facades (their
  repositories were never wired) now work identically on all three, each landed with
  a cross-runtime conformance assertion.

  - **Merge threshold presets** — `merge_threshold_presets` + `DrizzleMergePresetRepository`.
  - **Board-scan repository blueprints** — `repo_blueprints` + `DrizzleRepoBlueprintRepository`
    (the blueprint reads; the `blueprints` pipeline step already ran on Node).
  - **Document sources** — `document_connections`/`documents` + repos; the Confluence /
    Notion / GitHub-docs provider shells are promoted into `@cat-factory/integrations`
    so both facades compose the same providers.
  - **Ephemeral environments** — `environment_connections`/`environments` + repos;
    `HttpEnvironmentProvider` promoted into `@cat-factory/integrations`; a Node
    `setInterval` TTL-teardown sweeper mirrors the Worker's expiry cron.
  - **GitHub projections + inline sync** — `github_branches`/`github_pull_requests`/
    `github_issues`/`github_commits`/`github_check_runs` + `github_sync_cursors` and the
    full read/write projection repos, so the runtime-neutral `GitHubSyncService`'s inline
    webhook/backfill ingest persists on Node; `WebCryptoWebhookVerifier` promoted into
    `@cat-factory/server`.
  - **Repo bootstrap** — `reference_architectures` + bootstrap runs stored as
    `kind='bootstrap'` rows of `agent_runs`; `ContainerRepoBootstrapper` promoted into
    `@cat-factory/server`; a **pg-boss durable bootstrap driver** (the analogue of the
    Worker's `BootstrapWorkflow`) replaces the previous "bootstrap isn't durable on Node
    yet" gap, and the stale-run sweeper now re-drives orphaned bootstrap runs too. The
    self-hosted runner pool (`RunnerPoolTransport`) now accepts the `bootstrap` dispatch
    kind — the harness `/bootstrap` route needs no Cloudflare primitive, so a pool runner
    serves it just like the local Docker transport — so a real bootstrap run dispatches +
    pushes for real on Node, not just on local.
  - **Prompt-fragment library (ADR 0006)** — `prompt_fragments`/`fragment_sources` +
    `DrizzlePromptFragmentRepository`/`DrizzleFragmentSourceRepository`; the runtime-neutral
    `LlmFragmentSelector` promoted into `@cat-factory/agents`. Opt-in via
    `PROMPT_LIBRARY_ENABLED`/`PROMPT_LIBRARY_SELECTOR`, wired exactly like the Worker's
    `selectFragmentLibraryDeps` (repos + installation resolver + selector), so the managed
    tenant fragment catalog feeding every agent run works identically on all three.

  The Worker keeps the same behaviour (it gains the new conformance assertions and the
  shared promoted classes). **Breaking on Node/local:** these features now require their
  new tables — boot-time `migrate()` applies them; there is no data to preserve.

  The Node/local Drizzle migration lineage was re-baselined to a single fresh
  `drizzle-kit generate` migration off the current `schema.ts` (the prior hand-authored
  folders had no snapshots, which blocked `db:generate`); `db:generate`/`db:check` are
  green again. Safe because no deployed database depends on the old lineage.

  Deferred (still Worker-only, flagged for follow-up): real-time push (Node `realtime`
  gateway still `501`s — needs a WebSocket hub over Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`),
  queue-backed async GitHub ingest (Node ingests inline rather than via a pg-boss queue),
  and GitHub rate-limit telemetry (Node keeps the no-op repository).

- 70e8ef0: Make in-org shared boards fully interactive, and tighten the shared-service model.

  A workspace that MOUNTS a service from another workspace can now edit it like its own: a
  shared service's blocks live in one home workspace, and board mutations resolve them there
  (authorized by the mount) instead of 404ing on the workspace-scoped lookup.

  - `BlockRepository.findById` (D1 + Drizzle) resolves a block by id across the org; `BoardService`
    uses it so `updateBlock`, `moveBlock`, `addTask`, `addModule`, `removeBlock`,
    `toggleDependency` and `reparent` act on the shared copy at its home workspace. A frame move
    writes the requesting board's mount layout (per-workspace), leaving the shared block untouched.
  - Cross-service `reparent` across two services homed in **different** workspaces moves the
    subtree's block rows (and any executions on them) to the destination service's home, re-stamped
    with the destination service — preserving the "a service's blocks live in its home" invariant.
  - **Every** top-level frame now registers as an account-owned service via the shared
    `registerServiceForFrame` helper — including **seeded demo boards** and **repo bootstrap**, which
    previously created unshareable, unbadged frames.
  - Executions and bootstrap runs now stamp `service_id` from their block at write time (D1 +
    Drizzle), so a shared service's **live** runs surface on every board that mounts it — not just
    pre-migration rows. `BootstrapJobRepository.listByService` + `BootstrapService.listJobs` compose
    a mounted service's in-flight bootstrap into the snapshot.
  - Real-time `boardChanged` now carries the affected block, so `FanOutEventPublisher` fans
    structural changes (module materialised, run cancelled, bootstrap finished) out to every
    mounting board live, not just on reload.
  - `services.frame_block_id` is now UNIQUE (D1 + Drizzle), enforcing the 1:1 frame↔service mapping.
  - Removed N+1s on the snapshot hot path (`composeBoard`) and the GitHub sync fan-out
    (`linkedWorkspaces`).

  The Node facade wires the service repos into the engine but, lacking a real-time transport,
  does not yet decorate its publisher with `FanOutEventPublisher` (noted in its container).

- 70e8ef0: Deduplicate GitHub sync effort within an org.

  Incremental-sync cursors were keyed per `(workspace_id, repo_github_id, kind)`, so two
  workspaces in the same account that both tracked a repo each kept their own ETag/`since`
  cursor and each reconcile pass fetched the repo from GitHub independently — N API
  round-trips for one repo per org.

  - Sync cursors are now keyed by `(installation_id, repo_github_id, kind)` (D1 migration
    `0032`): a repo is fetched from GitHub **once per org**.
  - `GitHubSyncService.syncRepo` fans each projection out to **every** workspace in the org
    that links the repo, so one fetch keeps all the boards consistent; a second workspace's
    reconcile pass becomes a cheap conditional `304`. A `full` pass (used at repo-link time)
    bypasses the shared cursor so a freshly-linked workspace is still fully populated.

  Projection reads stay per-workspace and unchanged. Verified: the worker GitHub suite
  (28 tests) passes with the installation-scoped cursor + fan-out.

  Operational note: migration `0032` rebuilds `github_sync_cursors` (the rows are pure sync
  bookkeeping, no user data), so the first reconcile pass after deploy runs cursorless and
  re-fetches each repo once — a one-time cost that settles back to conditional `304`s.

- b287996: Give every pipeline step its own runner job id so sibling steps in one run can't read
  back each other's results.

  Every container step of a run was dispatched and polled under the bare execution id,
  which is ALSO the per-run container's address. The harness keys its per-kind job
  registries by that id and `GET /jobs/{id}` checks them in a fixed order, so two steps
  that ran close enough together to share the still-warm container collided: a poll for
  one step returned another step's finished result. The visible symptom was an
  `architect` (`/explore`) step returning the `spec-writer`'s (`/spec`) document verbatim
  with no model call of its own — and, latently, `blueprints`/`mocker` reading back the
  `coder`'s result.

  The fix separates the two conflated identifiers into an explicit `RunnerJobRef`:

  - **`runId`** — the run (execution). On backends that share one container across a run
    (the Cloudflare per-run Container, the local Docker container) this addresses that
    container, and `release` reclaims it.
  - **`jobId`** — the job itself, now UNIQUE PER STEP (`<executionId>-<agentKind>`). The
    harness registers and polls each step's job by it, so siblings never alias.

  `RunnerTransport.dispatch`/`poll`/`release` and `RunnerJobClient` now take the ref;
  `AgentJobHandle` carries the `runId` so the poll/stop site can re-address the per-run
  container. The Cloudflare and local transports key the container by `runId` (one
  container per run, reclaimed as a unit) and read the harness job by the per-step
  `jobId`; a self-hosted pool, being per-job, keys on `jobId` (which already kept its
  steps distinct). Single-job flows (repo bootstrap/scan) use the same value for both.
  The engine reclaims a run by its id and passes the in-flight step's job id so a pool can
  cancel exactly it.

  Breaking: `RunnerTransport` implementers now receive a `RunnerJobRef` instead of a bare
  job-id string. The local container label moves from `cat-factory.jobId` to
  `cat-factory.runId`.

- 197264e: Self-hosted runner pools: serve every harness kind and forward structured results.

  Two fixes to the runtime-neutral runner-pool transport (used by both the Cloudflare
  and Node facades for a workspace's self-hosted pool):

  - **Forward the whole structured result.** `HttpRunnerPoolProvider.mapJobView`
    previously copied only `prUrl` / `branch` / `summary` / `error` off a finished job,
    silently dropping every structured product — so a pool-backed `tester` produced no
    `testReport`, a `merger` no assessment, a `blueprints`/`spec-writer` no tree/doc. The
    response mapping gains an optional `resultPath` pointing at the harness `result`
    envelope; when set, the provider coerces and forwards `report` / `service` / `spec` /
    `assessment` / `defaultBranch` / `pushed` / `resolved` / `usage` (type-guarded, with
    the structured products passed through for the engine to validate). The individual
    scalar paths still apply and override.
  - **Serve every harness route, with no allow-list.** A pool runs the same
    executor-harness image as the Cloudflare backend, and runtime parity is the default
    (the "keep the runtimes symmetric" guideline), so `RunnerPoolTransport` dispatches
    every kind with no opt-in `POOL_SUPPORTED_KINDS` guard to gate them. A new harness kind
    reaches a pool automatically, exactly as it does a Cloudflare container, instead of
    silently diverging until it is added to a list.

- 37baa7f: Scheduled recurring pipelines on services.

  A service (a `frame` block) can now carry **recurring pipelines** that re-run a
  pipeline on a cadence — primarily **Dependency updates** and **Tech debt**. A
  schedule runs every `intervalHours`, optionally constrained to an allowed window
  (weekdays + an hour-of-day range, in a chosen IANA timezone), and owns one reused
  on-board task block inside the service that each fire runs the pipeline against
  (skipping any fire while a run is still in flight). Run history is kept ~1 week and
  surfaced in the inspector.

  - **Tech-debt pipeline** adds two agent kinds: a read-only `analysis` container
    agent that audits the repo, then a special non-LLM `tracker` step that files a
    **GitHub issue or Jira ticket** from the analysis before implementation. The
    tracker is a per-workspace selection (`GET|PUT /workspaces/:ws/tracker-settings`);
    `GitHubClient` gains `createIssue`. The runtime-neutral `TicketTrackerService`
    resolves each **tenant's own** connected integration (it is injected with a
    `fileGitHubIssue` filer + a `resolveJiraConnection` resolver, never shared/env
    credentials): on Cloudflare it files GitHub issues through the workspace's GitHub
    App installation against the service's repo, and Jira tickets (markdown→ADF) using
    the workspace's encrypted `task_connections`. Two new seed pipelines:
    `pl_dep_update`, `pl_tech_debt`.
  - **Per-tenant tracker on the Node facade**: both trackers now work on Node, each
    resolving the **workspace's own** integration. Jira: the task-source integration is
    wired on Node (always on; requires the shared `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) — a Drizzle
    `task_connections`/`tasks` store + the runtime-neutral Jira provider — so each tenant
    connects its own Jira through the existing UI (credentials encrypted at rest). GitHub:
    the filer mints a short-lived token from that workspace's own GitHub App installation
    (reusing the per-tenant App infra) and resolves the service's repo from the
    `github_repos` projection — no shared/env credentials.
  - **Persistence + scheduling are symmetric across runtimes**: D1 migration
    `0029_recurring_pipelines.sql` ⇄ Drizzle schema + generated migration; the
    Cloudflare `scheduled` cron fires due schedules (and prunes run history) ⇄ a Node
    `setInterval` sweeper does the same. New ports `PipelineScheduleRepository` /
    `TrackerSettingsRepository` with D1 + Drizzle implementations; the cross-runtime
    conformance suite covers schedule CRUD, `runDue`, and the tracker setting.
  - **UI**: an "Add recurring pipeline" button on the service frame (mirroring "Add
    task") opens a per-frame modal (pipeline + cadence editor; the tracker choice is
    surfaced inline for the tech-debt pipeline). The schedule's block shows a recurring
    badge on the board; selecting it reveals the cadence, run-now/pause, and run
    history in the inspector.

- 2ab06b5: Self-hosted runner pools: expose the dispatch `kind` + provisioning hints as
  first-class manifest template variables.

  `HttpRunnerPoolProvider` now surfaces three more `{{input.*}}` variables to a
  manifest's request templates, alongside the existing `{{input.jobId}}` /
  `{{input.job}}`:

  - `{{input.kind}}` — the harness route the job targets (`run`, `blueprint`, `spec`,
    `explore`, `bootstrap`, `ci-fix`, `resolve-conflicts`, `merge`, `on-call`, `test`,
    `fix-tests`). The values map 1:1 to the harness route names, so a transparent
    proxy can route straight to a per-kind endpoint with `pathTemplate:
"/{{input.kind}}"` instead of parsing the embedded `{{input.job}}` JSON.
  - `{{input.instanceType}}` / `{{input.cloudProvider}}` — the provisioning hints the
    transport stamps on when the service pins a size/provider, so a self-provisioning
    pool (k8s/Nomad) can map them to a node selector / resource request / queue
    declaratively in the manifest.

  These were already carried inside `{{input.job}}`; exposing them flat lets a
  path/query/header template route and size without decoding the job JSON. Backward
  compatible — existing manifests that forward `{{input.job}}` are unaffected. The
  operator/integrator playbook (`docs/runner-pool-integration.md`) is fully rewritten
  to match current behaviour (all kinds incl. bootstrap route to a pool; only the
  synchronous repo scan stays Cloudflare-only).

- de5a9d7: Add configurable Slack notifications as an additional delivery transport for the
  existing notification mechanism (merge_review / pipeline_complete / ci_failed) —
  not a parallel system. A new `SlackNotificationChannel` implements the same
  `NotificationChannel` port the in-app channel does and is composed alongside it via
  `CompositeNotificationChannel`, so the engine call sites that raise notifications
  are untouched.

  Two scopes, mirroring the GitHub-App precedent:

  - The Slack **connection** (the installed team + its bot token) is bound
    **per-account**. The bot token is multi-tenant data, so it is encrypted at rest
    with `WebCryptoSecretCipher` (HKDF tag `cat-factory:slack`) and never returned on
    the wire — only safe metadata (team name/icon, bot user, scopes) is exposed.
    Onboarding is UI-based: a full OAuth "Add to Slack" flow when the app credentials
    are configured (`SLACK_CLIENT_ID`/`SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`/`SLACK_REDIRECT_URL`),
    with manual bot-token paste always available as a fallback.
  - Notification **routing** (which types post, to which channel) is configured
    **per-workspace**.
  - Optional **@-mentions** are **role- and audience-aware**, not a workspace
    broadcast. The per-account member map tags each member `product` or `engineering`,
    and each notification type mentions a specific audience: requirement-review
    findings ping **product** people **plus the task's creator**, while the engineering
    notifications (merge_review / pipeline_complete / ci_failed) ping **only the task's
    creator**. This adds a `requirement_review` notification type (raised by the
    requirements reviewer when it produces findings) and records a `createdBy` on
    blocks (a new nullable column on both runtimes), captured from the authenticated
    user at task creation.

  New surface: the `slack` contracts, the kernel Slack repository ports, the
  `@cat-factory/integrations` Slack module (`SlackNotificationChannel`,
  `SlackConnectionService`, `SlackSettingsService`, `SlackMemberMappingService`,
  `SlackApiClient`), the shared `SlackController` (+ public OAuth callback) and
  `SlackConfig`, and the orchestration `SlackModule`. Persisted on **both** runtimes:
  the Cloudflare D1 tables (migration `0037_slack.sql`) and the Node Postgres tables
  (Drizzle schema + generated migration), with both facades wiring the channel +
  management module. The cross-runtime conformance suite asserts the routing and
  member-map persistence parity on both stores.

  This change also closes a pre-existing parity gap: the Node/Drizzle facade now has
  a `notifications` table + `DrizzleNotificationRepository` and wires
  `notificationRepository`, so the notification subsystem — and any channel composed
  onto it — fires on the Node runtime exactly as on the Worker.

  Opt-in via `SLACK_ENABLED=true` (requires `ENCRYPTION_KEY`); off by default, so
  unconfigured deployments are unaffected.

- 2dd7e56: Step observability + a discoverable iteration-cap decision.

  - Every pipeline step now carries the `runId` of the run it belongs to, surfaced on
    the step-detail panel (copyable) so a lone step in a log line or view names its run.
    It is a read-time projection (always equals the enclosing run's id), stamped on read
    and on emit; not persisted independently.
  - A step's duration now stops counting once it is terminal OR parked on a human. The
    engine records `pausedAt` when a step parks on an approval / decision / iteration-cap
    gate and clears it when the step resumes or finishes, so elapsed time no longer
    accrues while the run waits for input (the symmetric counterpart of the terminal
    freeze). A step finished directly out of a parked approval is billed to the pause
    instant, not the later human decision.
  - An iterative gate that spends its automatic budget (a quality companion at its rework
    cap, or the requirements reviewer at its iteration cap) now raises a
    `decision_required` notification. Previously the three-choice decision was reachable
    only by drilling into the parked step, so the run looked silently stuck; the inbox
    item now opens that step's decision surface (companion → step detail with the
    iteration-cap prompt; requirements → the review window).

  No DB migration: the step fields ride in the existing execution `detail` JSON, and the
  notification `type` column is free text in both runtimes.

- 5ca8086: Add alternate subscription-backed coding harnesses (Claude Code / Codex) alongside
  the Pi proxy harness.

  - New per-workspace **subscription token pool** (`provider_subscription_tokens`,
    D1 + Postgres, encrypted at rest) with usage-aware rotation, behind a kernel
    port + `ProviderSubscriptionService`, wired into all three runtimes.
  - A guided **LLM Vendors** navbar UI to connect Claude / Codex / GLM (Z.ai) /
    Kimi (Moonshot) / DeepSeek subscription credentials (token pool, write-only).
    GLM / Kimi / DeepSeek all run via Claude Code against the vendor's
    Anthropic-compatible endpoint; the unfiltered credential list covers every vendor.
  - The executor-harness image now bundles the Claude Code and Codex CLIs; the
    harness selects `pi` / `claude-code` / `codex` per job from the model, and the
    subscription harnesses authenticate direct-to-vendor (no proxy) and report token
    usage from the CLI event stream for rotation + telemetry.
  - The model catalog becomes a canonical-model → provider map with precedence
    **subscription > direct > cloudflare** ("subscriptions always win"): latest
    Opus/Sonnet + GPT-5.5/5.4 (subscription-only), GLM-5.2/Kimi gain a Claude-Code
    subscription flavour, and `ModelOption` now carries per-flavour cost, context
    window, and a `quotaBased` flag (subscription usage is flat-rate quota, never
    billed against the spend budget).
  - A block's model is shared by all its pipeline steps, so a pin to a subscription-only
    model (Claude Code / Codex — container-only, no provider key) is degraded to the
    step's env-routing default for every INLINE LLM path through one shared seam
    (`inlineModelRef` / `resolveInlineModelRef`): both the inline agent executor and the
    requirements reviewer/rework, so the inline steps run instead of hard-failing and the
    two paths can't drift. The claude-code subscription harness repairs malformed
    structured output through the vendor's own Anthropic-compatible endpoint (the Pi
    harness still uses the proxy; Codex keeps the graceful no-repair path).
  - Hardening: the per-vendor token pool is capped to bound growth; the leased
    subscription credential is scrubbed from subscription-repair error details (not just
    GitHub-shaped secrets); and Codex token usage is read from its cumulative
    `total_token_usage` so multi-turn runs attribute usage correctly for rotation.

- 7dc8e57: Link integration context at task creation, GitHub issues as a source, and feed
  all linked context to every agent step.

  - **Linked context now reaches every step.** Documents (Confluence / Notion / …)
    and tracker issues (Jira / GitHub) attached to a task were only rendered into the
    prompts of the generic agent kinds — the four standard phases (architect, coder,
    reviewer, tester) silently dropped them, so the agents doing the work never saw
    the linked requirements/issues. The engine already resolves this context per step
    (`ExecutionService.buildAgentContext`); a shared `linkedContextSection` is now
    appended to every kind's user prompt (`@cat-factory/agents`), standard phases
    included.
  - **Attach context when creating a task.** The "Add a task" modal now lets you
    select already-imported documents and issues and links them to the new task on
    creation (previously only possible from the inspector after the fact).
  - **GitHub Issues as a task source.** A new `github` task source reuses the
    workspace's installed GitHub App (no separate credentials): it resolves the
    installation that owns the issue's repo and fetches the issue body + comments via
    the existing `GitHubClient` (new `getIssue`). Refs accept a full issue URL or the
    `owner/repo#number` shorthand. Wired in when `TASK_SOURCES` includes `github` and
    the GitHub integration is enabled.

- cc8d96a: Flesh out the Tester agent, add an agent configuration-contribution mechanism, and
  make Mocker always precede Tester.

  - **Pipelines:** every built-in pipeline that runs a `tester` now runs `mocker`
    immediately before it, so the Tester has its external-dependency mocks up.
  - **Config contribution:** agents (built-in or custom, via the agent registry's new
    `configContributions`) declare task-level config parameters. The union over a
    task's pipeline appears on task creation + the inspector and freezes once the
    contributing agent's step starts. Values persist as a sparse `agentConfig` map on
    the block (keys/values length-capped); the catalog rides the workspace snapshot. The
    Tester contributes its `environment` (local vs ephemeral) and Playwright its e2e
    target (CI vs ephemeral). The old fixed `testTarget` block field is dropped — its
    column is dropped on both runtimes too (no backwards-compat shim).
  - **Tester → Fixer loop:** `tester` is now a container agent that runs the project's
    tests — standing infra up locally via the service's docker-compose (rootless
    Docker-in-Docker in the harness) or against an ephemeral environment — and returns
    a structured report (what was tested, outcomes, concerns, greenlight). On a
    withheld greenlight the engine loops a new dedicated `fixer` agent with the report
    and re-tests, up to the task's merge-preset attempt budget. Only **blocking
    (high/critical)** concerns withhold the greenlight — low/medium are advisory, so a
    trivial nit can't burn the whole fixer budget — and the engine re-applies that rule
    defensively over the report. When the budget is spent (or there's no PR branch to
    fix, or the report is unparseable) the run fails for real (the tester step is left
    un-`done`) and raises a human-actionable `test_failed` notification (retry action),
    mirroring the CI gate. New harness `/test` + `/fix-tests` endpoints; reports + fixer
    summaries render in the inspector and step detail.
  - **Service + provisioning config:** a service frame carries the Tester's
    docker-compose path / "no infra dependencies" toggle (a Tester pipeline can't start
    until one is set), plus a cloud provider and abstract instance size that resolve to
    the concrete instance-type id forwarded to the runner. Per-service sizing applies to
    the self-hosted-pool and local-Docker backends; the Cloudflare Container backend has
    a fixed per-class instance type (`wrangler.toml`) with no per-dispatch override, so
    it ignores the hints (pick `cloudflare` when you don't need per-service sizing).
  - **Account default cloud provider (fully wired):** accounts carry a
    `defaultCloudProvider` new services inherit — persisted on both runtimes, settable
    via `PATCH /accounts/:id` (owner-only) and the account menu, returned on the account
    wire, and pre-filled as the service editor's provider default.
  - **Local mode is 100% Docker/Podman:** a new first-class `docker` cloud provider
    represents the local daemon. The local runner backend sizes each per-job container
    from the abstract instance size (`--memory`/`--cpus`) and runs the Tester job
    `--privileged` so it stands its docker-compose infra up with Docker-in-Docker on the
    host daemon — never Cloudflare. A Tester-only pipeline with no PR branch now fails
    cleanly (no fixer to push to) instead of throwing.
  - Mirrored across both runtimes (D1 migration ⇄ Drizzle schema + migration).

- 3e6a844: Workspace creation/onboarding overhaul: real users, non-GitHub auth, invites,
  named+described boards.

  - **Persistent identity**: a new `users` + `user_identities` model replaces the
    GitHub-numeric-id identity. Memberships, `blocks.created_by`, personal
    subscriptions, and the session payload are all re-keyed to a generated `usr_*`
    id. (BREAKING: pre-existing personal accounts — keyed by GitHub login with a null
    `owner_user_id` — stop matching and a fresh personal account is created on next
    sign-in; old member-mapping rows keyed by GitHub id are orphaned. No migration,
    per the pre-1.0 policy.)
  - **Non-GitHub auth**: email/password (WebCrypto PBKDF2 hashing) and Google OAuth
    login alongside GitHub. New-user creation is invite-only plus an optional
    `AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` self-signup allowlist (fail-closed). A user without
    a GitHub account works fully — repo access is via the GitHub App, not a user token.
  - **Email invitations**: invite teammates by email into an org account; the invitee
    redeems a tokened link to gain membership. Email is sent via a pluggable
    `EmailSender` (SendGrid / Resend adapters) whose provider + API key are
    **onboarded per-account in the UI and stored sealed in the DB** (not env), like
    the Slack bot token. New tables: `users`, `user_identities`, `account_invitations`,
    `email_connections` (D1 + Drizzle).
  - **Board name + description**: `Workspace.description` end to end (create + edit).
  - **Onboarding discovery**: org members see and open existing org boards from the
    switcher instead of being forced to create one.
  - Slack member-mapping is re-keyed from `githubUserId` to the internal `userId`.

### Patch Changes

- 9d3a956: Clarity reviewer (bug-report triage) + bug investigator: a new bug-fix pipeline front.

  Adds two new agents at the front of a new `pl_bugfix` ("Triage & fix bug") pipeline preset:

  - **`bug-investigator`** — a read-only container agent (it runs the shared `/explore`
    harness path used by `architect`/`analysis`, so no new harness endpoint or image change).
    It clones the repo, reads the codebase from the raw bug report, and returns a prose
    enriched report plus an OPTIONAL working hypothesis — which it omits unless reasonably
    confident, so a low-confidence guess never misdirects the fix. Its output feeds the
    clarity reviewer (the triage subject) and the coder (a non-binding lead, via `priorOutputs`).
  - **`clarity-review`** — an inline engine gate step that triages the bug report for
    _fixability_ (repro steps, expected-vs-actual, environment, affected area), mirroring the
    requirements-review iterative loop (raise findings → answer/dismiss → incorporate into one
    standard-format clarified report → re-review until it converges, with the same per-task
    `maxRequirementIterations` / `maxRequirementConcernAllowed` knobs). The converged clarified
    report substitutes downstream as the task description for the spec-writer/coder (when both
    a requirements and a clarity review exist, the requirements doc wins).

  Persisted as a new `clarity_reviews` table on BOTH runtimes (D1 migration
  `0002_clarity_reviews` + Drizzle migration), wired in both facades' containers with a new
  `clarity` event on the real-time transport and a `clarity_review` notification type. A
  cross-runtime conformance assertion pins the clarified-brief substitution against both
  stores.

- b48c455: Internal cleanup — no behavior or API changes. Deduplicates repeated helpers into
  shared modules: the subtask-snapshot comparison (`sameSubtasks`/`sameSubtaskItems`)
  used by the execution + bootstrap flows now lives in `@cat-factory/kernel`
  (`domain/subtasks.logic`), a `getErrorMessage` helper replaces the repeated
  `error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)` expression, the shared
  `STANDARDS_FOOTER` prompt line is centralized in `@cat-factory/agents`
  (`agents/prompt-shared`), and the identical document/task in-memory provider
  registries now extend a generic `MapSourceRegistry` exported from
  `@cat-factory/kernel`.
- 8eed38c: Author relative imports with explicit `.js` extensions across the shared backend
  packages so their emitted `dist` is directly resolvable by Node's ESM loader (no
  bundler required). This lets the Node runtime run the built output on plain Node
  (`node dist/main.js`) — no tsx, no esbuild bundle — and is inert for the Cloudflare
  Worker (wrangler bundles regardless). `handlebars/runtime` is imported as
  `handlebars/runtime.js` for the same reason (its type is sourced from the full
  package, type-only). No behaviour or public-API change.
- 4030da2: Fix a 500 when flagging a repo as a monorepo while adding it as an existing
  service. The add-service flow flips the monorepo toggle (and browses the tree)
  before the repo is linked to the workspace, but `setRepoMonorepo` /
  `listRepoDirectory` threw `Repo … is not linked` for an untracked repo. Both now
  lazily link the repo via `linkRepo` first, throwing only when the repo isn't
  accessible to the installation.
- 157cd02: Standardize the executor-harness job API on a single `POST /jobs` endpoint with the
  agent kind carried in the request body, instead of one route per kind (`/run`,
  `/bootstrap`, `/merge`, …).

  Breaking wire change between the runtime transports and the harness image (acceptable
  pre-1.0: the two ship together, no external consumers). The old per-kind-route image
  is incompatible with the new transports, so the runner image MUST be republished and
  deployed.

  - Harness: `server.ts` is now table-driven — one `KINDS` registry keyed by kind drives
    a single `POST /jobs` dispatcher (reads the body's `kind` to pick the validator +
    registry) and a single `GET /jobs/{id}` poll. Adding an agent kind is one table
    entry, not a new endpoint + registry global + poll-chain branch. Bumps the runner
    image tag (1.7.2 -> 1.7.3) in `deploy/backend` (`image:publish` + wrangler.toml).
  - Harness: the explore job's temp-dir/log label field is renamed `kind` -> `label` so
    it no longer collides with the reserved dispatch discriminator `kind`.
  - Server: `ContainerAgentExecutor` stamps the kind into the dispatch body (the explore
    body now sends `label` for its agent-kind label).
  - Worker + local-server transports POST `{ ...spec, kind }` to `/jobs`;
    `LocalDockerRunnerTransport` drops its `KIND_ROUTE` map. The self-hosted pool already
    forwards `kind` in the spec, so it needs no code change — only the manifest docs
    (kernel/contracts/integrations) are updated to note the harness routes by the body's
    `kind`.
