- cec0c3e: Attach spec-sized requirements documents when creating a task over the public API.

  `/api/v1` had no way to give a run a specification. `description` caps at 2,000 characters because
  it is a task's own framing, echoed into every prompt; the 50,000-character `POST /jobs` brief drives
  inline pipelines that never touch a repository; and the app's own attach-a-document flow is
  session-authed. A headless caller holding a PRD could only paste a truncated version of it into a
  field and hope. `POST /api/v1/services/:serviceId/tasks` now takes an ordered `documents` list, each
  entry either NAMING a page in a connected document source (imported and attached, as `ticket`
  already does for a tracker issue) or CARRYING the text itself. The full body reaches agents exactly
  as a document a human attached does: materialised under `.cat-context/` for a container agent,
  folded into the prompt for an inline one.

  Carrying the text needed a document with no source behind it, so `DocumentOrigin` (`DocumentSourceKind`
  plus `upload`) is now what a stored row and its block/role links are keyed by, while everything a
  provider does stays typed against the narrow union. That keeps the missing `upload` provider a
  compile error rather than an `undefined` at whichever call site reaches for it first. An uploaded
  document has no origin URL, and every reader now renders that absence as nothing rather than as
  `Title ()` or a bare `Source:` line.

  One fix rode along, found by the cross-runtime assertion for the new origin rather than by
  reasoning: `urlMatchCandidates` used to hand back `['', '/']` for an empty needle, so `getByUrl`
  would match every row whose stored `url` is empty. Nothing produced such a row before uploads, and
  no caller passes an empty URL today, but "a lookup for nothing resolves to an arbitrary uploaded
  document, which the caller then hands an agent as the page a description pointed at" is not a trap
  to leave armed. It now returns null, and the four repositories that call it answer "no match".

  A document is now attached to at most ONE block, enforced where the link is written rather than at
  the new endpoint. `linkedBlockId` is a single column, so attaching a document another task already
  holds MOVED the link instead of copying it: the earlier task silently lost a document it was created
  with, and nothing in its next run reported the absence. That was reachable from the app's own
  picker too, which offers already-attached documents for re-use. `linkToBlock` now refuses with
  `document_already_linked` and the holder's id, the same rule and shape as one-task-per-ticket, with
  translated SPA copy. Two things keep it from wedging anything: a link naming a DELETED block is not
  a holder (so the guard heals rows left by past deletes), and `removeBlock` now detaches a doomed
  block's documents through the removal cascade, so new ones are not made. Only the link goes; the
  document survives its task.

  Attaching a list is one unit of work rather than a loop: `linkManyToBlock` asserts the block once,
  resolves the whole list through a new batched `DocumentRepository.listByRefs` and writes the links
  through a new `linkBlockMany` (both mirrored D1 ⇄ Drizzle, with cross-runtime assertions, plus
  `detachBlocks` for the cascade). The point method in a loop was three round-trips per document, ten
  of which re-read the same block.

  Worth watching in review: the creation is all-or-nothing. Everything refusable (an unconfigured
  source, an unparseable ref, a page the provider will not serve, an upload that renders to no
  readable text, a document another task holds) is refused before the board changes, and an
  attachment that fails after the task exists takes the task back off the board, because a task
  silently missing part of its spec is the failure this whole surface exists to prevent. Two ordering
  details carry that: uploads are written only after the whole list resolves (an import is idempotent
  on its ref, but every upload mints an id, so an eager write would leave one orphan per retry), and
  the rollback detaches by BLOCK rather than by the refs it resolved (a rollback can be running
  because one of those refs belongs to another task, and clearing it by ref would commit the very
  loss the guard just refused). The attach runs before the ticket claim so that rollback can never
  orphan a claimed ticket. Naming `documents` does not work in mothership mode yet, for the same
  reason `ticket` does not: the document write surface is still `pending` on the persistence
  allow-list, which the new `linkBlockMany`/`detachBlocks` join rather than widen.

### Minor Changes

- 8cbf1a7: Manage the outbound notification webhook over `/api/v1`, so the whole integration surface is
  headless.

  `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/v1/notification-webhook` (`admin` scope) register, read and remove the one
  HTTPS endpoint a workspace pushes its notifications, run-lifecycle events and platform-health
  alerts to. Until now that endpoint could only be registered over the session-authed
  `/workspaces/:ws/notification-webhook`, so a deployment driven entirely by API keys had to put a
  human in a browser to switch on the very channel that exists because there is no browser: the
  delivery contract was headless and its enrolment was not.

  The routes delegate to the same `NotificationWebhookService` the session controller calls, so the
  SSRF guard on the endpoint, the keep-on-omit rule for every field and the one-row-per-workspace
  invariant are identical whichever surface writes. The signing secret stays write-only: `PUT`
  accepts one and the read reports only `hasSecret`, so an `admin` key can rotate it and can never
  learn the stored one.

  `PUT`'s `url` becomes optional, on both surfaces, so keep-on-omit is uniform across every field
  rather than every field but one. A mandatory re-send made the routine edit (subscribe to a family)
  carry a value the caller never meant to change, and a client re-sending a URL it cached before
  someone else rotated the receiver would silently redirect the workspace's deliveries back to the
  old endpoint while appearing to add a subscription. `url` is still required on the first `PUT`
  against a workspace with nothing registered, refused with `details.reason: "webhook_url_required"`.
  Relaxing a required field is additive, so no live caller changes.

  Additive on `/api/v1` (OpenAPI `info.version` 1.5.0; main took 1.4.0 for its own additive change
  while this branch was open). The four SDK clients gain a `webhook` resource
  (`get` / `set` / `delete`) and the MCP facade the matching `webhook_*` tools.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a8acd48: Bring the published MCP server under the repo's publish guards and give it the protocol depth the
  generator already had the data for.

  The tool table now declares an `outputSchema` for every operation that answers with a JSON object and
  returns `structuredContent` beside the text, so a host or agent framework can consume a result without
  re-parsing prose. Those schemas are rendered deliberately loosely (no `required`, no `enum`, no closed
  `anyOf`, no bounds, and for a union not even `type`): a caller's MCP client validates against them and
  `/api/v1` is additive forever, so anything stricter would let an older copy of this package reject a
  newer deployment's honest answer. `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` are now set on the operations whose consequence is real
  money or a merged pull request, and left unset elsewhere so the protocol's cautious defaults stand.

  Two behaviour changes to know about:

  - **A result over `CAT_FACTORY_MCP_MAX_RESULT_CHARS` is now refused rather than truncated**, with a
    message naming the size, the limit and the way out (`limit` / `cursor` / `offset`, or a bigger cap).
    Half an object cannot satisfy the output schema it was cut out of, and the old `[TRUNCATED]` prefix
    spent the whole cap delivering the instruction to narrow instead of reading on.
  - **Results are compact JSON**, not two-space indented.

  New configuration: `CAT_FACTORY_API_KEY_FILE` reads the key from a file instead of the host's
  plaintext config (setting both is refused, not resolved by precedence), and
  `CAT_FACTORY_MCP_TOOLS` / `CAT_FACTORY_MCP_EXCLUDE_TOOLS` filter per tool beside the existing group
  filter, so withholding the PR-merging `notifications_act` no longer costs the whole inbox group. Every
  filter is stated in the server's instructions, and a combination that would expose no tools at all
  fails at startup.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 43fd5c0: Add `@cat-factory/mcp-server`: a Model Context Protocol facade over the public API, so an MCP host
  can drive a workspace directly (plan work on the board, start and watch runs, answer parked
  decisions, read a run's telemetry).

  It is a facade rather than a fifth client. The tool table is rendered by `pnpm gen:sdk` from the
  same `docs/openapi.json` the four SDKs are generated from, and every tool is one call on
  `@cat-factory/sdk` — so it cannot drift from the surface it exposes, and it re-implements none of
  the SDK's auth, retry, error, pagination or encoding behaviour. `pnpm check:sdk` covers it.

  Every operation is a tool except the two SSE endpoints: a tool call returns one result over no
  streaming channel, and a bounded "wait for the run" tool would be a timeout dressed up as an
  answer, since a parked run waits for a human indefinitely by design. The server names both
  omissions, and their alternatives, in its instructions; generation fails on a new streaming
  operation nobody has classified.
