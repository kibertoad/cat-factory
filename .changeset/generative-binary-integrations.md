Register generative binary integrations (image / music / video generation APIs) in a deployment's own code, and let binary-generating agent steps select them.

`BinaryGeneratorRegistry` is a new app-owned registry beside the foundational-service one: an integration declares the content types it produces (`image | audio | video | 3d | document`), its media types, endpoint, API contracts and the credential it needs BY NAME. A step picks from it via `stepOptions.binaryOutput.generatorIds` and states the content types it must deliver via `.modalities`; run admission refuses an unregistered id or an uncovered content type under the new `binary_output_generator_invalid` conflict reason. The agent's `.cat-context/binary-output/brief.md` now leads with a Generation section describing each integration, and the credential value reaches only that job's agent process (job body `generatorSecrets`), never a prompt or the telemetry snapshot.

Breaking, pre-1.0: `PipelineStep.binaryOutputs` gains a required `unknownGenerators` array, so reports recorded before this change no longer parse — an affected step's declaration record is re-created on its next run. `ToolSecretResolver.resolve` takes a discriminated `subject` (`tool-server` | `binary-generator`) in place of `serverId`; a deployment implementing that port per workspace must update its signature.
