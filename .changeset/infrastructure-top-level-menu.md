feat: move infrastructure configuration into its own top-level navbar menu. Agent-container execution + Tester environments + (local mode) the warm-container pool / checkout reuse now live in a dedicated tabbed "Infrastructure" window reached from the navbar, instead of being buried in the Integrations hub and a separate "Local mode" entry. The old bare "delegate to runner pool" toggle is replaced by a clear execution-backend selector that reflects the backends available for THIS deployment (local Docker host / Cloudflare Containers / self-hosted runner pool) and which is active — driven by a new symmetric `infrastructure` capability descriptor on `GET /auth/config` (set by every facade; asserted by the cross-runtime conformance suite). The raw-JSON runner manifest editor is kept but collapsed behind an "Advanced: custom API-based scheduler" disclosure, since the common backends don't need it.
