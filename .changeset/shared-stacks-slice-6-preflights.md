Stack recipes & shared stacks (slice 6): preflight prerequisite checks with guided remediation.

A stack recipe can now declare machine `prerequisites: PreflightRef[]` — automated PROBE + human REMEDIATION checks for the inherently-manual one-time machine setup a complex compose repo needs (docker daemon reachable, free disk / RAM, container-registry login state, VPN reachability, mkcert CA, hosts-file entries, an env-file secrets marker). They are re-run at provision start: a failing REQUIRED check fails the provision fast with its copy-paste remediation in the provisioning log, instead of a mystery deep inside a 40-image pull (a non-required check is advisory — a warning). A `POST /workspaces/:ws/preflights/run` endpoint runs an arbitrary set of checks for the setup wizard's live re-check.

- Contracts: `PreflightCheckId` / `PreflightParams` / `PreflightRef` / `PreflightResult` (`preflights.ts`) + `prerequisites` on `stackRecipeSchema`; the `runPreflightsContract` route.
- Kernel: the runtime-bound `PreflightHostProbes` seam + `PreflightProbeOutcome`, and a `runPreflights` seam on `ProvisionEnvironmentRequest`.
- Integrations: `PreflightService` (runtime-neutral orchestration over the probe seam) + provision-start enforcement in `ComposeEnvironmentProvider`.
- Server: `PreflightController`.
- Local facade: `createDockerPreflightProbes` (the host probes over the docker CLI + `node:*`), wired only where the compose runtime is (a Docker-family host daemon). The probes are runtime-bound (local facade only, the documented compose exception); the declaration + API are runtime-neutral and the recipe rides the existing `provisioning` blob, so there is no migration. On the Worker / plain Node the preflight API 503s and a recipe that declares prerequisites fails loudly at provision.
