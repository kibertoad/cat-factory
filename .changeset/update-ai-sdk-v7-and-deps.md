Upgrade the Vercel AI SDK family to v7 (paired with `workers-ai-provider@4`) and refresh the rest of the dependency tree within the supply-chain release-age gate.

- **AI SDK v7 / Cloudflare Workers AI**: `ai@^6 → ^7`, `@ai-sdk/openai`/`@ai-sdk/anthropic`/`@ai-sdk/provider` `^3/^4 → ^4`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@^2 → ^3`, `@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock@^4 → ^5`, and `workers-ai-provider@^3 → ^4`. This is now possible because `workers-ai-provider@4` accepts `ai@^7` peers, lifting the pin that previously held the family at v6. The only code change required is reading the AI SDK v7 usage shape (`usage.inputTokenDetails.cacheReadTokens` in place of the removed `usage.cachedInputTokens`).
- **Dependency sweep**: within-range refresh of the tree plus targeted bumps of `@cloudflare/workers-types@^4 → ^5` (aligns with the `wrangler@4` peer), `@opentelemetry/exporter-*-otlp-http@^0.220 → ^0.221` (lockstep with the `@opentelemetry/*@2.10` SDKs), and `oxfmt`, `undici`, `pg-boss`, `@nuxtjs/i18n`, `happy-dom`, `vue-tsc`, `wrangler` and others to their latest release-age-compliant versions. The `@cat-factory/executor-harness` runner-image deps are deliberately untouched.
